Manufacture of a Personage</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">JOHN CARLSON began the rehearsals of
&#8220;Nicoline&#8221; in early August of 1895. For
a week he tried to correct the hot labours
of the whole, large company. He was nervous
about this production. His digestion interfered.
His temper grew explosive. The leading woman
was alarmed for her gentility. The leading man
disliked his part of a cheap rake. Carlson
abandoned the minor folk to his stage manager,
Rothenstein, and nursed these two clumsy celebrities
toward a certain ease. But his stomach
suffered. He attended the opening night of
&#8220;The Prisoner of Zenda&#8221; at the Lyceum, fainted
during the second act and was revived with
brandy in Mr. Frohman&#8217;s office. The brandy
gave him fever; he spent the six days remaining
before &#8220;Nicoline&#8221; opened, in his bed. Yet on a
warm Monday night he dressed his gaunt body
gorgeously, shaved his yellow face, thrust an
orchid into his coat and dined at Martin&#8217;s with
young Mr. Fitch who had adapted &#8220;Nicoline&#8221;
from the French. Carlson swore in Swedish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
when agony seized his stomach. Mr. Fitch, sipping
white Burgundy, observed that it must be
pleasant to swear incomprehensibly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure,&#8221; said Carlson, shivering, &#8220;but what was
you sayin&#8217;?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll feel better by midnight,&#8221; Mr. Fitch
murmured, &#8220;You&#8217;ve worried too much. This&#8217;ll
be a hit. It&#8217;s been a hit in London and Paris.
The critics&#8221;&mdash;the adapter smiled&mdash;&#8220;won&#8217;t dare
say anything worse than that it&#8217;s immoral. And
Cora Boyle will make them laugh in the third act,
so that&#8217;ll be safe.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Boyle? Who&#8217;s she? That black headed gal
that plays the street walker, y&#8217;mean? She&#8217;s no
good. Had her last winter in Mountain Dew.
Common as dirt and no more sense than a
turnip.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Fitch answered in his affable whisper, &#8220;Of
course she&#8217;s common as dirt. That&#8217;s why I
asked you to get her. Why waste time training
some one to be common when the town&#8217;s full of
them?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But that ain&#8217;t actin&#8217;, Clyde!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s quite as good. And,&#8221; Mr. Fitch declared,
&#8220;she&#8217;s what the women like.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You always talk as if women made a show
pay!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That happens to be just what they do, Mr.
Carlson. That&#8217;s why Richard the Third doesn&#8217;t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
make as much money as Camille or East Lynne.
Women come to a play to see other women wear
clothes they wouldn&#8217;t be seen in and do things
they wouldn&#8217;t dream of doing. Please try to eat
something.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re all wrong,&#8221; Carlson said, chewing a
pepsin tablet.</p>

<p>Mr. Fitch shrugged, arranged his moustaches
and mentioned a dozen actresses whose success
was built on the art of enchanting their own sex.
Carlson had a respect for this playwright&#8217;s
opinion and while the two early acts of &#8220;Nicoline&#8221;
played he saw from his box that Cora Boyle&#8217;s
swagger carried some message to the female part
of the audience. For her, women laughed loudly.
They merely sniffled over the well bred woes of
the heroine. The heroine&#8217;s antics were insupportable.
The second curtain fell and Carlson descended
to the dressing room of this unsatisfactory
gentlewoman, gave a rasping lecture that scared
her maid away. He had to help hook her gown
and yelled over the powder of her advertised
shoulders, &#8220;If you want that sassy Boyle gal to be
the hit of the show, go on! You act like you&#8217;d
lost your last cent on the races and had sand in
your shoes. Now, you!&#8221; A feeling of heated
blades in his stomach stopped the speech. He
heard the stage manager knock on the dressing
room door. The actress moved weeping past his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
anguish. He leaned on the table and saw his
sweating face in the tilted mirror. The thin,
remote music of the orchestra began behind the
curtain. This third act was set in the rowdy café
of a small French city. If it went well, the play
was safe, would last out the winter, make him
richer. He should go up to his box and show
himself unperturbed to rival managers civilly
tranquil in their free seats. But he leaned, looking
at his wet, bald head with a sick weariness.
What was the use of this trade? He wore down
his years trying to teach silly women and sillier
men to act. He got nothing from living but
stomach trouble and money. The money would
go to his sister in Stockholm when he died. He
had never liked his sister, hadn&#8217;t seen her in thirty
years. He pitied himself so extremely that tears
wriggled down the spread of seams in his yellow
face. Life was an iniquity contrived for his torture.
Carlson deeply enjoyed his woe for five
minutes. Then Mr. Fitch came in to urge that
Cora Boyle be corrected before her present entrance.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the good, Clyde? She ain&#8217;t any sense.
She&#8217;s a actress, ain&#8217;t she?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;ll spoil the act if she carries on too much,&#8221;
said Mr. Fitch and at once Carlson thrilled with
an automatic anxiety; the act mustn&#8217;t be spoiled.
He hurried up the iron stairs to the platform,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
wiping his face. Cora Boyle was standing ten
feet back from the canvas arch that was, for the
audience, the street door of the Café Printemps.
She patted the vast sleeves of her gaudy frock
and whispered to a fellow in blue clothes. Carlson
had to pull her from these occupations and
gave his orders in a hiss.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you laugh too loud when Miss Leslie&#8217;s
tellin&#8217; about her mother or talk as loud as you&#8217;ve
been doin&#8217;, neither. This ain&#8217;t a camp meetin&#8217;,
hear?&#8221;</p>

<p>The black haired girl grinned at him, nodding.
She spat out a fold of chewing gum and patted
her pink sleeves again. She said, &#8220;All right,
boss, but, say, don&#8217;t the folks like me, though?&#8221;</p>

<p>Fitch chuckled behind the manager. Carlson
wouldn&#8217;t be bested by an impudent hussy who was
paid thirty-five dollars a week and didn&#8217;t earn it.
He stared at Cora Boyle, biting his lips and hunting
words wherewith to blast her. She let him
stare unchecked. A false diamond on its thin
chain glittered and slid when she breathed into
the cleft of her breasts. She was excellently
made and highly perfumed. Her black eyes
caught a vague point of red from the rim of a
jaunty hat that slanted its flowers on the mass
of her hair. She had rouged her chin to offset
a wide mouth. Carlson jeered, &#8220;Better get somebody
to show you a good makeup, sister, and quit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
talkin&#8217; through your nose. You sound like
you&#8217;re out of New Jersey!&#8221;</p>

<p>Cora Boyle giggled. She glanced at the fellow
in blue and said, &#8220;I was boardin&#8217; at Fayettesville,
New Jersey, all summer. Wasn&#8217;t I, Mark?&#8221;</p>

<p>The fellow bobbed his head, shuffling his feet.
His feet were bare and by that sign Carlson knew
him for the supposed peasant lad who would
bring the heroine news of her dear mother&#8217;s death
at the end of the act. Cora Boyle gave this unimportant
creature a long, amorous look, then
told Carlson, &#8220;I was boardin&#8217; with Mark&#8217;s
folks. He&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your cue,&#8221; said Mr. Fitch and the girl, with
a splendid swagger, marched into the lit scene
beyond this nervous shadow. Her finery shimmered
and directly the women outside the hedge
of footlights laughed. The audience tittered at
her first line and Mr. Fitch, a hand on his
moustache, smiled at Carlson.</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s got a voice like a saw,&#8221; Carlson
snapped and walked down the steps. At the
bottom a roar halted him. The audience
laughed in a steady bawl. He grunted but the
noise came in repeating volleys every time the
girl&#8217;s shrill speech rose grinding and these bursts
had an effect of surging water wonderful to hear,
soothing his conceit. But as he listened a spasm
took his stomach. Fitch helped him to a cab<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
and the cab delivered Carlson trembling to his
valet in 18th Street.</p>

<p>The attack lasted all night and did not wane
until twilight of next day when Carlson could
drink some drugged milk and roll a cigarette.
He bade his valet bring up the morning papers
and was not surprised when Fitch preceded the
man into the room, walking silently on his trim
feet, a flower in his blue coat and his white hands
full of scribbled foolscap.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been writing two scenes in the library,&#8221;
he said, in his usual, even whisper, &#8220;and I&#8217;d like
to read them, if you feel well enough.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Two scenes?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;One&#8217;s for the first act and one&#8217;s for the last.
I&#8217;d like a full rehearsal in the morning, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>Carlson lifted himself and slapped the counterpane.
He cried, &#8220;Now, Clyde, listen here!
That Boyle gal&#8217;s got enough. I expect she hit
but she&#8217;s a sassy little hen. I&#8217;m not goin&#8217; to spoil
her with&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nom de dieu,&#8221; said the playwright, &#8220;I didn&#8217;t
say anything about the Boyle girl. No. These
scenes are for young Walling. He can come on
with some flowers for Nicoline in the first act and
say something. Then he can bring the dogs in
at the last, instead of the maid. We might dress
him as a gamekeeper in the last act. Green coat,
corduroy breeches&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>Carlson screamed, &#8220;Cord&#8217;roy pants? Who
the hell you talkin&#8217; about? Walling? Who&#8217;s
Walling?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Fitch lit a cigar and selected a paper from
the bundle the valet held. He bent himself over
the back of a cherry velvet chair which turned
his suit vile purple in the dusk and began to read
genially.... &#8220;&#8216;Into the sordid and sensuous
atmosphere of this third act there came a second
of relief when the messenger brought Nicoline
news of her mother&#8217;s death. We too rarely see
such acting as Mr. Walling&#8217;s performance of this
petty part. His embarrassed, sympathetic stare
at Nicoline, his boyish, unaffected speech&mdash;&#8217;&#8221;
The playwright laughed and took another paper,
&#8220;That&#8217;s William Winter. Here&#8217;s this idiot.
&#8216;This little episode exactly proves the soundness of
Carlson&#8217;s method in rehearsing a company. I am
told that Mark Walling, the young actor who
plays the rôle, has been drilled by Mr. Carlson
as carefully as though he were a principal&#8217;&mdash;I
told him that,&#8221; Mr. Fitch explained, changing
papers. &#8220;&#8216;One of the best performances in the
long list of forty was that of Mark Walling as&#8217;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Carlson lay back dizzy on his pillows and
snarled, &#8220;What&#8217;s it all about, for hell&#8217;s sake?
This feller comes on and gives the gal the letter
and says the funeral&#8217;ll be next day. Well?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said his ally, &#8220;I&#8217;d just put you in your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
cab. I was out in front, standing. This boy
came on. They were still laughing at Cora
Boyle. The minute Walling spoke, every one
shut up. He gave his line about the funeral and
some women commenced snivelling. Wiped his
nose on his sleeve. Some more women cried. I
thought they&#8217;d applaud for a minute. He&#8217;s in
all the papers. Nice voice. It&#8217;s his looks
mostly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never noticed him. Where did we get
him?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Fitch blew some smoke toward the red
velvet curtains and chuckled. &#8220;We didn&#8217;t get
him. He belongs to Cora Boyle. She brought
him to Rothenstein at the first rehearsal and
asked for a part for him. She kidnapped him
down in Jersey.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She&mdash;what?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Kidnapped him.&#8221; The playwright assumed
a high drawl and recited, &#8220;Cora, she was boardin&#8217;
with Mark&#8217;s folks down to Fayettesville. Mark,
he used to speak pieces after supper. Cora, she
thought he spoke real nice&mdash;So she kidnapped
him. She mesmerized him&mdash;like Trilby&mdash;and
brought him along. She&#8217;s got him cooped up at
her boarding house. She&#8217;s married him. He
says he thinks acting&#8217;s awful easy&#8221;&mdash;Mr. Fitch
again drawled, &#8220;cause all you gotta do is walk
out, an&#8217; speak your piece. He&#8217;s got a brother<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
name of Joe and his mamma she&#8217;s dead and sister
Sadie she&#8217;s married to Eddie something or other.
I heard his whole family tree. I went to see him
this morning. Some one else is likely to grab
him, you know? He told me his sad story in a
pair of blue drawers and one sock. He&#8217;s scared
to death of Cora Boyle.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But&mdash;can he act?&#8221;</p>

<p>The playwright shook his head. &#8220;No. He
hasn&#8217;t any brains. Are you well enough to get
dressed?&#8221;</p>

<p>At half past ten an usher came into the box
office where Carlson was sitting and summoned
the manager to the rear of the house. Fitch
stood at the throat of an aisle, his pallor made
orange by the glow from the stage on which Cora
Boyle was chaffing the sinful heroine. Amusement
sped up this lustrous, stirring slope of heads.
It was the year of Violette Amère among perfumes
and the scent rolled back to Carlson with
the laughter of these ninnies who took Cora
Boyle for a good comedian. Carlson chafed,
but when the lad in blue walked into the light
of the untinted globes, this laughter flickered
down. Fitch whispered, &#8220;Hear?&#8221; and promptly
the boy spoke in a husky, middling voice that
somehow reached Carlson clearly. Close by a
woman gurgled, &#8220;Sweet!&#8221; and Carlson felt the
warm attention of the crowd, half understood it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
as the few lines drawled on. The boy stood
square on his brown, painted feet. His flat face
was comely. He had dull red, curling hair. As
he tramped out there was a faint and scattered
rumour like the birth of applause, cut by the
heroine&#8217;s shriek.</p>

<p>&#8220;You see?&#8221; Fitch smiled.</p>

<p>Carlson said, &#8220;I ain&#8217;t a fool. Tell Rothenstein
to call a rehearsal for ten in the mornin&#8217;,
will you.&#8221; He then went briskly to hunt down
this asset. It took some minutes to locate the
dressing room Mark Walling shared with five
other small parts. He found Mark peeled to
faded, azure cotton underclothes and talking
happily to a tall, fair rustic who slouched on the
wall beside the sink where Mark scrubbed paint
from his feet with a sponge. Their drawls
mixed and shut from them the noise of Carlson&#8217;s
step, so the manager regarded his prize stealthily.
Mark was a long lad, limber and burly, harmlessly
good looking. His nose was short. His
insteps and arms were thick with muscle. He
smiled up at his rural friend who said, &#8220;But it
ain&#8217;t a long trip, Bud. So I&#8217;ll get your papa to
come up nex&#8217; week.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mark shifted the sponge to his other hand
and sighed. The sound touched Carlson who
hated actors not old enough to court him cleverly.
But this was a homesick peasant. He listened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
to Mark&#8217;s answer of, &#8220;Wish you would, Eddie.
I ain&#8217;t sure papa likes my bein&#8217; here. Even if I
do&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>The rustic saw Carlson and mumbled. Mark
Walling hopped about on one foot and gave
a solemn, frightened gulp. Carlson nodded,
inquiring, &#8220;That your brother, sonny?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, sir. Joe&#8217;s home. This is Eddie Bernamer.
Well, he&#8217;s my brother-in-law. He&#8217;s
married with Sadie.&#8221;</p>

<p>Eddie Bernamer gave out attenuated sounds,
accepting the introduction. The manager asked
lightly, &#8220;How many sisters have you, son?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just Sadie. She&#8217;s out lookin&#8217; at the play.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you&#8217;ve married Cora Boyle?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Mark, &#8220;that&#8217;s so.&#8221;</p>

<p>He seemed rather puzzled by the fact,
suspended the sponge and said to Eddie Bernamer,
&#8220;She ain&#8217;t but two years older&#8217;n me,
Eddie.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess Mr. Carlson wants to talk to you,
Bud,&#8221; his relative muttered, &#8220;So I&#8217;ll go on back
and see some more.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you&#8217;ll come round an&#8217; wait after the
show?&#8221; Mark wailed.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll have to catch the cars, Bud. Well,
goo&#8217; bye.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mark stood clutching the sponge and sighed
a monstrous, woeful exhalation after Eddie Bernamer.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
His grey eyes filled. He was hideously
homesick, certain that Fayettesville was a better
place than this cellar that stunk of sweated cloth
and greasy paint. And Cora hadn&#8217;t been strikingly
pleased by the news of him in this morning&#8217;s
papers. She was odd. He wiped his nose on a
wrist and looked hopelessly at Carlson.</p>

<p>&#8220;Rather be back on the farm, wouldn&#8217;t you?&#8221;
the gaunt man asked.</p>

<p>Mark sat down on the floor and thought. His
thoughts went slowly across the track of six
weeks. He plodded. For all its demerits this
red and gold theatre was thrilling. People were
jolly, kind enough. The lewd stagehands had
let him help set a scene tonight. The man who
handled the lights had shown him how they were
turned on and off to make stormy waverings.
Cora was exciting. Winter at home was plagued
by Aunt Edith who came out from Trenton to
spend the cold months at the farm and who
lectured Mark&#8217;s father on Methodism. And
here was this easy, good job. If he worked hard
it might be that Mr. Carlson&mdash;who wasn&#8217;t now
the screaming beast of rehearsals&mdash;would let him
run the lights instead of acting. Mark said,
&#8220;Well, no. Just as soon stay here, I guess.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How old are you, sonny?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Goin&#8217; on seventeen, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll give you forty a week to stay here,&#8221; said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
Carlson, &#8220;Fitch tells me you think acting&#8217;s pretty
easy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see any trick to acting,&#8221; Mark mused,
absorbing the offer of forty dollars a week,
&#8220;There ain&#8217;t nothin&#8217; to it but speakin&#8217; out loud....
Yes, I&#8217;d like to stay here.&#8221; He wanted to
show himself useful and got up, pointing to the
bulbs clustered on the ceiling in a bed of tin, &#8220;I
should think you&#8217;d ought to save money if you
had them down here by the lookin&#8217; glasses instead
of this gas, y&#8217;see? The fellers don&#8217;t get any
good of the electric light while they&#8217;re puttin&#8217;
paint on, and&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Rehearsal at ten in the morning,&#8221; said Carlson,
&#8220;Good-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>Marked gaped at the black and empty door.
Then his homesickness swelled up and he sighed,
squeezing the sponge. His body trembled
drearily. He lowered his head as does a lonesome
calf turned into strange pastures.</p>

He Progresses</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">&#8220;NICOLINE&#8221; lasted until April, 1896.
Mark played the country boy in &#8220;Mr.
Bell&#8221; all the next season and, duly
coached by Sarah Cowell LeMoyne, figured
as the young duke in &#8220;The Princess of Croy&#8221;
when Carlson imported that disaster in the
autumn of 1897. Its failure afflicted Mark less
than his private griefs. He played for four
months in Carlson&#8217;s Boston stock company.
This was penible. He had never been so far
from his adored family. True, freed of Cora,
he could send ten or twenty dollars a week to his
father but he missed Sundays in Fayettesville and
the Boston wind gave him chilblains. The
friendly women of the Stock Company found
him shy and here began the legend of Mark&#8217;s
misogyny. He read novels and tramped about
Boston, surveyed the theatrical setting of Louisburg
Square and sidelong admired the ladies
walking rigidly in sober hats on Commonwealth
Avenue. Such persons, he mused, would never
fling hot curling irons in a husband&#8217;s face and it
wasn&#8217;t possible to imagine them smoking cigarettes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
in bed. But he hated Boston and the war
was welcome as it honourably pulled him back to
a New Jersey Infantry regiment.</p>

<p>In June, 1898, he sat on a palmetto trunk in the
filthy camp of Tampa watching Eddie Bernamer
pitch a ball to Joe Walling. Mark had every
satisfaction in the sight and liked his piebald
uniform much more than any costume hitherto.
The camp pleased him as a problem. There
would be plays made on the war, of course, and it
wouldn&#8217;t be easy to mount them. These bright
trees and the muddle of railroad ties could be
effected but the theatre lacked lights to send down
this parching glitter on black mud and strolling
men. He sighed for realism. He had spent
hours in Davidge&#8217;s workshop while the grass of
&#8220;The Princess of Croy&#8221; was being made. It
hadn&#8217;t the right sheen. The sunset had turned
it blue and the sunset was all wrong even though
the critics had praised it. Mark swung his
gaiters and pondered irreproducible nature. But
it would be nice to counterfeit all this&mdash;the glister
of remote tin roofing, the harsh palms, the listless
soldiery. The police would object to exactness
of course. Brother Joe was pitching the ball
with great flexures of his bronze, naked chest.
Eddie Bernamer swore astoundingly when he
ripped his undershirt. One couldn&#8217;t be so honest
on the stage or echo the sharp, unreal note of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
mail call sounding. Mark ran off to see if the
wayward postal service had brought him a letter.
There was a roll of newspapers addressed to his
brother-in-law and Bernamer, a bad reader,
turned them over to Mark and Joe. It was Joe
who found the pencilled paragraph Mark rather
expected. He slapped Mark&#8217;s back and grunted,
&#8220;Well, so there y&#8217;are, Bud.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mark read, &#8220;The suit for divorce begun by
Mark Walling, the well known young actor
against his wife, Cora Boyle Walling, was concluded
yesterday. Neither party to the action
was present in court. Miss Boyle is touring the
West with the Jarvis Hope Stock Company. Jarvis
Hope is named as co-respondent in the case.
The action was not defended. Mr. Walling is
now with the &mdash;th N.J. Infantry. The divorced
couple were married in August, 1895. They
have no children.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good riddance to bad rubbish,&#8221; said Eddie
Bernamer, &#8220;and don&#8217;t you let the next woman
looks at you haul you off to a preacher, neither.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mark felt dubious. There had never been a
divorce in the family. He said, &#8220;I guess if we&#8217;d
had a baby, she wouldn&#8217;t of&mdash;Dunno.... It&#8217;s
kind of too bad.&#8221;</p>

<p>His relatives denied it. They had never liked
Cora Boyle. She wasn&#8217;t a lady and her clothes
had shocked Sadie&#8217;s conservative mind. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
pointed out that a stable and meritorious woman
wouldn&#8217;t have seduced Mark before marriage.
They were glad to see the boy free and were puzzled
by his mournfulness. He agreed with their
judgments. But his eyes moistened for all their
affectionate pawing. He muttered, &#8220;She was
awful good lookin&#8217;,&#8221; and sat moody while they
indicated advantages. He could save his pay,
now, and wear respectable, black neckties, as a
Walling should. He wouldn&#8217;t be bullied or have
hot curling irons flung in his face. He could
come home on the Saturday midnight train and
stay until Monday afternoon. And Joe reasonably
assured him that women were plentiful.
But Mark mourned, in his tangled fashion, the
collapse of beauty. Cora, he choked, didn&#8217;t
match her outside. She was ruthless, disturbing.
She cared nothing for Mark&#8217;s pet plan of an
ideal lighting system for theatres. She had
spilled coffee on his smudged, laborious chart of a
stage to be made in hinged parts. She called his
sacred family a parcel of mossbacks and left the
flat when Sadie and Bernamer brought their
baby to town for a day. Still, Mark was mournful
and often missed her for several years. He
shuddered from marriage as a game more complicated
than golf.</p>

<p>He was playing golf in May, 1902, with Ian
Gail when the English playwright checked his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
grammar. Mark flushed. The Englishman
fooled with a putter for a second, considering
this colour. He said, &#8220;I say, old son, d&#8217;you mind
my giving you some advice?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Go ahead.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Carlson&#8217;s closing the play next week, he tells
me. What will you do with yourself, all summer?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Go home.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s that and what&#8217;s it like?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mark sat down on the green and chattered of
the farm, and his family with particular mention
of his nephew George Dewey Bernamer (born
May 15, 1898) who called himself Gurdy.
About Joe Walling&#8217;s baby daughter Mark wasn&#8217;t
as yet enthusiastic. He talked with broad lapses
into New Jersey singsong. His grey eyes dilated.
He babbled like an upset pail. The lean
Englishman didn&#8217;t seem bored. Other people&mdash;Mrs.
LeMoyne, old Mrs. Gilbert&mdash;had scolded
Mark about these explosions. Gail let him talk
for twenty minutes of warm noon and then said,
&#8220;Quite right, old son. Stick to your people....
You&#8217;re a sentimental ass, of course. I dare say
that&#8217;s why you can put up with dinner at Carlson&#8217;s
in that seething mass of red plush.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I like Mr. Carlson. Been mighty good&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course he&#8217;s good to you. And it was
good of you to make him mount my last act so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
decently.... For some reason or other you&#8217;ve
an eye for decoration. That&#8217;s by the way.&mdash;Now,
I&#8217;ve a female cousin in Winchester, a Mrs.
Ilden. She writes bad novels that no one reads
and her husband&#8217;s in the Navy. I&#8217;m going to
write her about you. You run across after the
play stops. She&#8217;ll put you up for a month and
you&#8217;ll pay her&mdash;I suggest a hundred pounds.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pay her for what?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Her conversation, my boy. She&#8217;s quite clever
and fearfully learned. Shaw likes her. She&#8217;s
an anarchist and a determinist and all that and
much older than you. She makes a business of
tutoring youngsters who need&mdash;doing over a bit.
You seem to have been reared on Henty and
Shakespeare. Even Carlson says you need pruning.
There&#8217;s no use being antediluvian even if
you are a rising young leading man.... God,
how I hate the breed! I shouldn&#8217;t waste these
words on you if you didn&#8217;t show vagrom gleams
of common sense now and then. So I most
seriously beg of you to go and let Olive&mdash;Mrs.
Ilden, tutor you for a fortnight.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mark was always docile before authority. He
asked, &#8220;What&#8217;ll she do to me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She can tell you anything you want to know
and explain Winchester. The history of Winchester
is the history of England,&#8221; Gail said,
&#8220;and, of course, that&#8217;s the history of the world.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>Thus, in early June, Mark was driven through
Winchester and landed at the door of a brick
house painted plum colour. A grey wall continued
on either side of the ruddy front and nameless
vines waved on the coping. Mark&#8217;s head
ached from a supper at Romano&#8217;s the night
previous but he admired the house and the
obvious romance of the curving lane stippled with
sunshine in plaques of honey. He rang the bell,
gave a fat parlour-maid his card and waited for
Mrs. Ilden in stolid terror. The hall had white
panels of an approved stage pattern and was
dotted with photographs. Mark was looking at
the face of a bearded man whose eyebrows had a
diabolic slant when Olive Ilden came in from her
garden.</p>

<p>She came in a bad temper, deserting the discussion
of Chamberlain&#8217;s Imperial policy about
her tea table. She was prepared for a repetition
of her last paying pupil, the one son of a Rand
millionaire, a cub who wore five rubies on one
hand and who talked racing at four meals a day.
Mark unsettled her by his wooden stare and the
black decency of his dress. His clothes were
English. He was always tanned. The scar of
Cora Boyle&#8217;s curling irons lay in a thread along
his left jaw. Olive revised a theory that Americans
were short and looked up at him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve some friends at tea,&#8221; she said, &#8220;Of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
course, I don&#8217;t wish to impose tea on a Yankee.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think I&#8217;d like some,&#8221; Mark said miserably
and followed her trailing, white skirts down an
endless garden. He thought her gown distinctly
bad and sloppy. She must be older than she
looked or she wouldn&#8217;t be so careless. The
girdle was crooked and the gauze across her
shoulders was too tight. But it was a fine body,
tall and proportionate. Her hair was a lustreless
black. Meanwhile he had to think about
this scene of an English garden. It phrased itself
simply. Wall, rear. Tower of church,
right background. Two small children playing
with a kitten. Tea-table. Three ladies.
Young man in tweeds. One clergyman.&mdash;It was
like the garden set for the &#8220;Princess of Croy.&#8221;
Mark braced himself, bowed and murmured in
the manner of Mrs. LeMoyne, leaned on one
of the limes in the manner of Herbert Kelcey, and
drank his tea in the manner of Mr. Drew. The
minor canon gave him a cigarette and Mark
said, &#8220;Thanks so much.&#8221; The youth in tweeds
asserted that it was beastly hot for June and
Mark admitted, &#8220;Rather.&#8221; He stood sombre
against the lime and the group was chilled by his
chill. Two of the ladies fancied him a poet by
the red curling of his hair. The guests withdrew.
Olive Ilden fiddled with a teaspoon and frowned.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>&#8220;I rather expected you on Tuesday.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Had to stay in London. Mr. Carlson
wanted me to look at a couple of plays he&#8217;s thinkin&#8217;
of bringing over.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Really, I don&#8217;t see why you Yankees always
import our nonsense. One hears of the Pinero
rubbish playing for thousands of nights in the
States. Why?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The women like it,&#8221; he wildly said, quoting
Carlson. &#8220;Are those your kids?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mine and my husband&#8217;s,&#8221; Olive laughed and
called Joan and Robert Ilden from their game
with the kitten. Mark played with them in all
content for half an hour, didn&#8217;t glance at Olive,
and told her blond children about his best nephew,
Gurdy Bernamer. The bored infants broke his
watch chain and their puzzled mother took Mark
to walk. She led him down through the college
and wondered why he paused to stare at the
cathedral walls where the sunshine was pallid on
the weathered stone.&mdash;He was thinking that bulbs
tinted straw colour might get this glow against
properly painted canvas.&mdash;His eyes opened and his
drowsy gaze pleased the woman. She said, &#8220;Do
you like it? The cathedral?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The tower&#8217;s too small,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Clever of you. Yes, architects think so.
Glad you noticed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Anybody could see that. Is that the Bishop?&#8221;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
he asked, seeing black gaiters in motion on a lawn.</p>

<p>&#8220;A mere dean. And the birds are rooks.
All the best cathedrals have rooks about. Shall
we go in?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d just as soon,&#8221; he nodded, regretting that
the queer shade of the elms wasn&#8217;t possible on a
backdrop.</p>

<p>The interior charmed him. He forgot his
headache. His thoughts hopped. Church scenes
never went well. No way to capture this slow
echo for the stage. The upper brightness made
him raise his eyes. This range of high windows
where the lights melted together was called
a &#8220;clerestory.&#8221; The mingled glory almost
frightened him. He saw a white butterfly that
jigged and wheeled, irreverent, solitary on the
far shadows of the vault. Mark smiled. Small
Gurdy Bernamer named butterflies &#8220;bruffles&#8221; and
was probably chasing one, now, across the hot
perfume of the Fayettesville garden. The fancy
made him homesick. He blinked. The woman
watching him saw crystal wetness point his lashes
and hastily stated, &#8220;This is William de Wykeham&#8217;s
tomb.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mark examined the painted tomb, wished he
could sketch the canopy and the pygmy monks
who pray at the Bishop&#8217;s feet. Gurdy Bernamer
would like the monks and would break them.
He rubbed his nose and chuckled.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>&#8220;I suppose,&#8221; Olive said, &#8220;that all this seems
rather silly to you. You&#8217;re a practical people.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s good lookin&#8217;. I don&#8217;t see how a good
lookin&#8217; thing can be silly, exactly. I was thinkin&#8217;
my kid nephew&#8217;d like those monks to play with.
But he&#8217;d bust them.&mdash;Isn&#8217;t King William Rufus
buried here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve been reading a guide book!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no. That&#8217;s in history. They lugged
him here on a wagon or something and buried
him. Where&#8217;s he plant&mdash;buried?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mark wished that the dark lady would stop
frowning as she steered him to the glum, polished
tomb in the choir. He must be offensive to her.
She said, &#8220;This is supposed to be the tomb.
They&#8217;re not sure,&#8221; and Mark stared at the raised
slab of ugly stone with awe. The organ began
to growl softly in a transept. It was solemn to
stand, reflecting on the Red King while the organ
moaned a marching air. William Rufus had
been dead so long. History was amazing....
When he had a theatre of his own Mark meant
to open it with Richard III or with Henry V.
Carlson told him that no one would ever play
Richard III again as Booth had gone too high
in the part. But the Walling Theatre would be
opened with a romantic play full of radiant
clothes and scenes that would match the playhouse
itself. The Walling would have a ceiling of dull<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
blue and boxes curtained in silk, black as a
woman&#8217;s hair. The lamps should wane in the
new manner when the acts began and there would
be mirrors rimmed in faint silver to gleam in far
nooks of the balcony&mdash;something to shimmer in
corners and shadows of his dream.... Mark
stared down the nave and built his theatre against
the grey age of this place until Olive sat in a heap
of muslin on the tomb of William Rufus.</p>

<p>&#8220;One doesn&#8217;t have to bother about such an
indifferent king. There are some more in those
tins&mdash;I mean caskets&mdash;on top of the choir screen.
Edmund and so on.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;More kings? But won&#8217;t a&mdash;a sacristan or
something come an&#8217; chase you off of here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you know about sacristans?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Cathedrals always have sacristans in books.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I dare say you read quantities of bad novels,&#8221;
she observed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I like Monsieur Beaucaire and Kim
better&#8217;n anything I&#8217;ve read lately,&#8221; said her bewildering
pupil, &#8220;Say, who was Pico della Mirandola?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think I can talk about the Renascence
in Winchester choir,&#8221; Olive choked and took him
away.</p>

<p>Save for the studied clarity of voice he showed
no theatrical traits. He resented the sign of The
Plume of Feathers beside the West Gate because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
&#8220;it spoiled the wall.&#8221; He asked if the Butter
Cross was a well and bought several postcards
at a shop where the squared panes arrested him.
Olive made conjectures. She was twenty-six.
She had known actors in some bulk. This wasn&#8217;t
an actor, observably. She guided him back
toward the college and through a swarm of lads in
flannels. At these Mark looked and sighed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why that sob?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dunno. I s&#8217;pose because kids are havin&#8217; such
an awful good time and don&#8217;t know it. I mean&mdash;they&#8217;ll
get married and all that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you married?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mark said cheerfully, &#8220;Divorced.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell me about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;D&mdash;don&#8217;t think I&#8217;d better, Mrs. Ilden.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that American?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is&mdash;is what?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That delicate respect for my sensibilities.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t know what you mean exactly. I had
to divorce Cor&mdash;my wife and I&#8217;d rather not talk
about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Olive felt alarmed. She said, &#8220;I&#8217;m supposed
to tutor you in art and ethics and I&#8217;m merely trying
to get your point of view, you know? Don&#8217;t
look so shocked.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see what my gettin&#8217; divorced has to
do with art and ethics.... Oh, was this man
Leighton a better painter&#8217;n Whistler?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>His questions ranged from the salary of canons
to professional cricket. He wore a small and
single pearl in his shirt at dinner, sat eating
chastely and stared at Olive between the candles
that made his grey eyes black in the brown of his
face. The parlour-maid brought him the silver
bowl of chutney three unnecessary times. He
timidly corrected Olive&#8217;s views on farm labour in
the United States with, &#8220;I&#8217;m afraid you&#8217;re wrong.
I was brought up on a farm.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Really? I was wondering.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fayettesville. It&#8217;s up in the woods behind
Trenton. Say, what&#8217;s the Primrose League?&#8221;</p>

<p>For a week Olive tried to outline this mentality.
He plunged from subject to subject. Economics
wearied him. &#8220;What&#8217;s it matter what kind of
a gover&#8217;ment you have so long as folks get enough
to eat and the kids ain&#8217;t&mdash;don&#8217;t have to work?&#8221;
Religion, he said, was all poppycock. His
&#8220;papa&#8221; admired Robert Ingersoll and &#8220;What&#8217;s
it matter whether folks have souls or not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a materialist,&#8221; she laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, what of it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m trying to find out what your ethical
standards are. Why don&#8217;t you cheat at poker?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because it ain&#8217;t fair. It&#8217;s like stealin&#8217; a man&#8217;s
wife.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Some one stole your wife, didn&#8217;t he?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mark finally chuckled. &#8220;You&#8217;d hardly call it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
stealing. She just walked off when she knew I&#8217;d&mdash;heard
about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>He blushed, hoping he hadn&#8217;t transgressed and
hurriedly asked whether Bernard Shaw was really
a vegetarian. He had no opinion of Shaw&#8217;s plays
but thought &#8220;The Devil&#8217;s Disciple&#8221; a better play
than &#8220;Magda.&#8221; &#8220;The Sunken Bell&#8221; was &#8220;pretty
near up to Shakespeare.&#8221; He was worried
because &#8220;Treasure Island&#8221; couldn&#8217;t be dramatized
and recited &#8220;Thanatopsis&#8221; to the horror of
Olive&#8217;s children. Olive interrupted the recital.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;ll be quite enough, thanks! Wherever
did you pick up that sentimental rot?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just what is bein&#8217; sentimental?&#8221; Mark
demanded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Writing such stuff and liking it when it&#8217;s
written! I suspect you of Tennyson.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never read any. Tried to. Couldn&#8217;t, except
that Ulysses thing. Let&#8217;s go take a walk.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Too warm, thanks,&#8221; said Olive, wanting to
see whether this would hold him in his basket
chair under the limes.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be back about tea time,&#8221; Mark promised,
paused on his way up the garden to kiss Bobby
Ilden&#8217;s fair head as the little boy reminded him of
Gurdy Bernamer and vanished whistling &#8220;The
Banks of the Wabash.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All his clothes are black,&#8221; said young Joan
Ilden, &#8220;but I was helping Edith dust in his room<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
this morning and he has the nicest blue pyjamas.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do go pull Bobby out of the raspberries,&#8221;
Olive said and fell into a sulk which she didn&#8217;t
define. She lounged in her chair watching the
light play on the straight bole of a tree behind the
emptied place where Mark had been sitting....
Rage succeeded the sulk. This was a stupid
augmentation of her income. Olive disapproved
landholding but it would be easier every way
when Ilden&#8217;s uncle died and he came into the
Suffolk property. Then she would be able to live
in London instead of flitting there for a breath
of diversion. She hoped Mark would go to
London soon.... He had the mind of a badly
schooled stock-broker! Olive lifted her portfolio
from the table and penciled a note to her
husband. &#8220;I do wish you could slaughter your
dear uncle, Jack. Ian Gail has sent me a silly
Yankee to educate. I hope I have no insular
prejudice against the harmless, necessary Colonial
but this cad&mdash;&#8221; Then she thought. &#8220;What am
I saying here? I don&#8217;t mean it. I&#8217;m lying,&#8221; and
tore up the paper.</p>

<p>Mark went swimming in the Itchen and did not
come home until seven. He dressed in six
minutes and found Olive clad in black lace by the
drawing room mantel of white stone. He said,
&#8220;Say, I ran into a flock of sheep an&#8217; an old feller
with a crook. Do they still do that?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>&#8220;Do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Crooks. And he had on a blue&mdash;what d&#8217;you
call it?&mdash;smock?&#8221;</p>

<p>Olive laughed and lifted her arms behind her
head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you think some one was staging a pastoral
for your benefit? But you didn&#8217;t come home to
tea and there were some quite amusing people
here. I kept them as long as I could.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Too bad,&#8221; said Mark, &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You shouldn&#8217;t lie so. You&#8217;re not at all sorry.
You&#8217;re bored when people come and you have to
play the British gentleman. And there are so
many other things better worth doing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s in Shaw,&#8221; Mark guessed, &#8220;Clyde Fitch
was talkin&#8217; about it. But what&#8217;s wrong with
actin&#8217; like a gentleman?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the use? Your manners are quite
all right. If you&#8217;d talk to people and collect
ideas.... It&#8217;s so much more important to
straighten out your ideas than to stand and hold a
teacup properly. A butler can do that. I could
train a navvy to do that. And&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s an awful good looking dress,&#8221; he broke
in, &#8220;Nicest you&#8217;ve had on since I&#8217;ve been here.&#8221;</p>

<p>Olive let an arm trail on the mantel where the
stone cooled it. &#8220;I&#8217;m talking about your intellect
and you talk about my frock.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know something about dresses and I don&#8217;t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
know a thing about intellect. You ought to wear
dark things because you&#8217;ve got such a nice sk&mdash;complexion.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t bother about clothes except when
Jack&#8217;s at home and I want to keep his attention....
You were in Cuba, you said? Did you kill
any one?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t know. Tried to. Why?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was wondering whether you&#8217;d mind killing an
old duffer in Suffolk. He keeps my husband out
of twelve hundred a year and a decentish house.
Would you mind?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mark saw this was meant as a joke and laughed,
studying her arm which gleamed white on the
white stone.</p>

<p>&#8220;My husband&#8217;s uncle. He&#8217;s easily eighty and
he&#8217;s very Tory.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Haven&#8217;t got any uncles. Got an aunt that&#8217;s
pretty awful. She&#8217;s a Methodist.&#8221;</p>

<p>He wouldn&#8217;t look at her. He still stared at
the arm sprawled on the mantel and smiled like a
child. Olive wanted to hurt him suddenly, to
rouse him. The glowing stare was too childish.
She drawled, &#8220;I went into your bedroom to see
that they&#8217;d swept it decently. Are those the
family portraits on the desk? Who&#8217;s the fat girl
with the baby?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sadie. My sister. She&#8217;s puttin&#8217; on weight.
Papa keeps two hired girls now and she don&#8217;t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
have to cook. The yellow-headed fellow&#8217;s her
husband&mdash;Eddie Bernamer. Awful fine man.&#8221;</p>

<p>He beamed at Olive now, doting on Eddie Bernamer&#8217;s
perfections. Olive tried, &#8220;And the lad
with the very huge pearl in his scarf is your
brother? And they all live on your father&#8217;s
farm? And you go down there and bore yourself
to death over weekends?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t bore myself at all. I get all the New
York I want weekdays. Fine to get out and ride
a horse round. Nice house. We built a wing on
when Joe got married last year.&#8221;</p>

<p>The parlour-maid announced dinner. Mark
gave Olive his arm and wanted to stroke her arm
white across the black of his sleeve. He talked of
his family through the meal and after it, leaning
on the piano while Olive played. He tortured her
with anecdotes of his and Joe&#8217;s infancy and with
the deeds of Gurdy Bernamer. He sighed,
reporting that Sadie&#8217;s oldest girl had died.</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean you&#8217;re wearing mourning for a six
year old child!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; said Mark.</p>

<p>&#8220;And then you ask me what a sentimentalist
is!&#8221; Olive struck a discord into the Good Friday
Spell and sneered, &#8220;I dare say you think life&#8217;s so
full of unpleasantness that it shouldn&#8217;t be brought
into the theatre!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. I don&#8217;t think that, exactly. But I don&#8217;t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
think there&#8217;s any sense in doin&#8217; a play where you
can&#8217;t&mdash;can&#8217;t&mdash;well, make it good lookin&#8217;. These
plays where there&#8217;s nothin&#8217; but a perfec&#8217;ly ordinary
family havin&#8217; a fight and all that&mdash;A show ought
to be something more.&mdash;You get the music in an
opera. Carmen&#8217;d be a fine hunk of bosh if you
didn&#8217;t have the music and the Spanish clothes.
Just a dirty yarn!... There&#8217;d ought to be
somethin&#8217; good lookin&#8217; in a play.... Nobody
believes a play but girls out of High School....
If you can&#8217;t have poetry like Shakespeare you
ought to have something&mdash;something pretty&mdash;I
don&#8217;t mean pretty&mdash;I mean&mdash;&#8221; Olive stopped
the music. Mark descended rapidly and went on,
&#8220;I don&#8217;t care about these two cent comedies,
either.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t like comedy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not much. Truth is, I don&#8217;t catch a
joke easy. I&#8217;ve tried readin&#8217; Molière but it
sounds pretty dry to me. Haven&#8217;t tried&mdash;Aristophanes?&mdash;I
guess that&#8217;s deeper&#8217;n I could swim&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Rot! You mustn&#8217;t let yourself&mdash;what is it?&mdash;be
blinded by the glory of great names. Any
one who can see the point in Patience can understand
Aristophanes.... But you haven&#8217;t much
humour. But you&#8217;ve played in comedy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Some. I&#8217;d just as soon.&#8221;</p>

<p>Olive began &#8220;Anitra&#8217;s Dance&#8221; knowing that he
liked melodrama and watched his eyes brighten,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
dilating. She said amiably, &#8220;A fine comedian&#8217;s
the greatest boon in the world. Women
especially. Is it true that women who&#8217;re good in
comedy are usually rather serious off the stage?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t say&mdash;Well, my wife was pretty damn
serious!&#8221;</p>

<p>His huge sigh made Olive laugh. She asked,
&#8220;You&#8217;ve no children?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. Guess that was the trouble.&mdash;Play that
Peer Gynt Mornin&#8217; thing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve played enough,&#8221; said Olive. &#8220;You say
Mr. Carlson sent you over to look at some plays
for him? He must trust your judgment.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mark answered happily, &#8220;Sure. He says that
if I take to a play so&#8217;ll every one else. He says
I&#8217;ve got lots of judgment about plays.&#8221;</p>

<p>Olive shut the piano and rose. Her face
wrinkled off into laughter. She said, &#8220;You dear
thing! I dare say he&#8217;s quite right about that.
Good night.&#8221;</p>

<p>She strolled out of the drawing room and
Mark could see her passing up the long stairs.
She moved splendidly against the white panels.
One wrist caressed the rail. The black gown
dragged gently up the rosy treads. She vanished
slowly into the dark and Mark said, &#8220;Golly,&#8221; as
he went to get his hat. He wandered over to the
bar of the Black Swan and drank cold ale while
he meditated.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>He mustn&#8217;t fall in love. Eddie Bernamer and
Joe disapproved of affairs with married women.
They were right, of course. And nothing must
interfere with his tutelage. And Ilden was at
sea. But this was vexatious! He wished she did
not stroll so lazily up stairs, across gardens. He
wished that her hair wasn&#8217;t black.&mdash;He found
himself blushing at breakfast when she came in
with a yellow garden hat on the black of her hair.
Now that he&#8217;d begun to think of it she looked
rather like Cora Boyle.</p>

<p>He thought of Cora Boyle again in the garden
after luncheon. The children had left a green
rubber ball on the turf. Mark rolled it about
with one sole and watched Olive trim a patch of
dull blue flowers. His place and the ball underfoot
recalled something cloudy. He worked to
evolve a real memory and laughed. Olive
quickly glanced up.</p>

<p>&#8220;You keep asking about my wife. She was
boardin&#8217; with us at the farm. First time she ever
spoke to me I was kicking a ball around, in the
garden. This way. I was barefoot. Cora said,
&#8216;Ain&#8217;t you too old to go barefooted?&#8217; I forget
what I said.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But with the ball that day you played no
more?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That sounds like a piece of a play,&#8221; said Mark.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s from a comedy,&#8221; Olive snapped, &#8220;Do get<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
your hat and take a walk. I&#8217;ll be busy for an
hour. Look at the Deanery garden. The
Dean&#8217;s gone to Scotland.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Got to write a letter first. Boat from Liverpool
tomorrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>He mailed a letter to Joe&#8217;s wife, born Margaret
Healy, tramped down to the Close and examined
the Dean&#8217;s garden. It would make a neat setting,
the mass of the Cathedral to the left, the foliate
house to the right. A maid in black and white
passed over the grass and reminded him of Joe&#8217;s
wife again by a certain dragging gait. He went
into the cathedral and studied the Wykeham tomb
from all angles. Some tourists hummed in the
nave; a guide in a frock coat ambled after them
descanting thinly of dead kings. Mark fell into
a genial peace, leaned on a column, smiling at the
far roof. The feet of the tourists made a small
melody among the tombs and this seemed to
increase. He heard a rapid breath and saw Olive
with his coat over her arm. She panted, &#8220;I&#8217;ve
packed your things. They&#8217;re in the cab. At the
gates. Hurry. You&#8217;ve hardly time to get to the
station. Do hurry! I&#8217;ll telegraph to Liverpool
and ask them to hold a cabin&mdash;stateroom&mdash;whatever
they call them.&mdash;Oh, do hurry!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s happened?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, this!&mdash;I didn&#8217;t look at the cover&mdash;thought
it was from Jack&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>Mark snatched the telegram and read, &#8220;Joe
and Margaret killed wreck Trenton come if&mdash;&#8221;
then rolled the paper into his palm. Olive saw
his eyes swell and gasped, &#8220;Who&#8217;s Margaret?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Joe&#8217;s wife. Where&#8217;s cab?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;At the gates. Run.&#8221;</p>

<p>He dashed into the sun beyond the open doors
then the red hair gleamed as he came wheeling
back to gulp, &#8220;Send you a check from&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Olive spread her hands out crying, &#8220;No! I
shan&#8217;t take it!&#8221; and saw him rush off again. The
cab made no noise that she could hear. She
shivered as if a warming fire died suddenly in
winter and left her cold. Presently she struck
a palm on the stone beside her and said,
&#8220;Sentimentalist! Sentimentalist!&#8221; while she wept.
She made use of Mark, though, in her next novel,
The Barbarian, which began her success. Mark
was rather flattered by the picture and glad that
he hadn&#8217;t insulted this clever, wise woman by
making love to her. He thought of Olive as exalted
from the ranks of passionate, clutching females
and often wrote long, artless letters to her.</p>

Full Bloom</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">THE family council prudently allowed
Mark to adopt his brother&#8217;s orphan,
Margaret. He sometimes borrowed
Gurdy Bernamer to keep the dark child company
in his New York flat. By 1905 the borrowing
settled into a habit. Gurdy provided activity for
a French nurse and then for an English governess
despatched by Olive Ilden. He was a silent, restless
creature. He disliked motorcars for his
own unrevealed reason that they resembled the
hearses of his uncle&#8217;s funeral. He had a prejudice
against small Margaret because she looked
like her dead mother, an objectionable person
smelling of orange water, and because Mark made
a fuss over the child. He learned to read newspapers,
copying Mark&#8217;s breakfast occupation, and
in September, 1907, noted that Carlson and Walling
would tonight inaugurate their partnership
by the presentation of &#8220;Red Winter&#8221; at their new
45th Street Theatre. &#8220;Inaugurate&#8221; charmed
Gurdy. It conveyed an image of Mark and the
bony Mr. Carlson doing something with a monstrous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
auger. Mark had for ever stopped acting
in May, would henceforth &#8220;manage.&#8221; Curiosity
pulled Gurdy from the window seat of his playroom
in Mark&#8217;s new house on 55th Street. He
waited for a moment when the governess, Miss
Converse, was scolding young Margaret and
wouldn&#8217;t see him slide down the hall stairs. He
scuttled west, then south and navigated Broadway
until he reached the mad corner of 45th Street
where a gentleman took him by the collar of his
blouse and halted him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where are you going?&#8221;</p>

<p>Gurdy recognized a quiet character who came
to luncheons now and then. He said, &#8220;H&#8217;lo, Mr.
Frohman,&#8221; dutifully and looked about for the
theatre. The stooping man detained him gravely.</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought you weren&#8217;t old enough for shows.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m looking for Mark.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Frohman chuckled, leaning on a stick.
He said, &#8220;He&#8217;s in his office.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s that?&#8221;</p>

<p>Gurdy stared past the pointing stick and saw a
cream face of columns and windows. He saw
the stone above a ring of heads. People were
gaping at his calm acquaintance as if this plump,
tired man was a kicking horse. He remembered
civility and asked, &#8220;How&#8217;s your rheumatism?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Better,&#8221; said Mr. Frohman and limped away.</p>

<p>Gurdy pushed scornfully through the gapers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
and trotted into the white vestibule of the theatre
where men were arranging flowers&mdash;horseshoes of
orchids, ugly and damp, roses in all tints, lumps
of unknown bloom on standards wrapped in silver
foil. A redhaired, hatless youth listed the cards
dangling from these treasures and told Gurdy to
go to hell when Gurdy asked for his uncle but
another man nodded to stairs of yellow, slick
marble. On the landing Gurdy found a door
stencilled in gold, &#8220;Carlson &amp; Walling.&#8221; The
door opened into a room hung with photographs
where Gurdy saw Mark sitting on a table, surrounded
by men. Mr. Carlson, already sheathed
in winter furs, bullied a carpenter who corrected
the lower shelf of a bookcase. Gurdy stood
wondering at the furious shades of neckties and
the grey hard hats which Miss Converse thought
vulgar.</p>

<p>&#8220;My God,&#8221; said Carlson, &#8220;Mark, look at that
comin&#8217; in!&#8221;</p>

<p>Mark groaned. He had a compact with Mrs.
Bernamer that the borrowed boy shouldn&#8217;t enter
a theatre until he was twelve. He was tall
enough for twelve but he was only nine. He
stayed in the doorway, studying the red walls
of the room, his white socks far apart and his
hands thrust into the pockets of his short, loose
breeches. The callers stared at the tough legs
brown from summer on the farm. The boy&#8217;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
one patent beauty, his soft, pale hair, was hidden
by his English sailor cap and his white blouse was
spotted with ink stains. But the men grinned and
chuckled, admiringly. Gurdy made no sound
when Carlson set him on the top of the bookcase
but gazed contemptuously at the crowding men
and let himself be petted.</p>

<p>&#8220;When d&#8217;you inaugurate, Mark?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Eight fifteen, when you&#8217;ll be in bed, sonny.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gurdy drawled, &#8220;I don&#8217;t get to bed till quarter
of nine and you ought to know that by this time.&#8221;
He frowned, partly closing his dark blue eyes, as
the men laughed. &#8220;What are all those flowers
for?&#8221;</p>

<p>A man in a corner lifted his white face from
a book and whispered, &#8220;Those are gifts the
Greeks brought.&#8221; This caused stillness, then unpleasing
chuckles. Gurdy climbed down from the
bookcase and went to talk to Mr. Fitch. They
talked of French lessons and the vagaries of
governesses. The other callers complimented
Mark on the boy&#8217;s good looks. The flattery was
soothing after the strain of the last rehearsal.
Mark knew it for flattery. Gurdy&#8217;s face was too
long, his sober mouth too wide and his jaw prematurely
square. But the compliments were the
due of a successful actor turned manager. He
sat for a little watching Mr. Fitch lazily
chat with the boy as though he were a grown man.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
On the playwright&#8217;s warning he had lately
published a careful interview announcing Gurdy
and Margot as adopted children and his relationship
to them. But people still probably reported
Gurdy an illegitimate son and Margot his
daughter by Cora Boyle. Mark sighed and took
Gurdy down through the flowers to see the cream
and gold play house where men were squirting
perfume from syringes along the red aisles, killing
the smell of paint. He let Gurdy have a
syringe and went into the vestibule. The redhaired
clerk listing the gifts of other managers
handed him the card wet from its journey in a ball
of pink roses.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mrs. Cosmo Rand.... Who the devil&#8217;s
Mrs. Cosmo Rand, Billy?&#8221;</p>

<p>The clerk scratched his ear and grinned.
&#8220;You&#8217;d ought to know, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I don&#8217;t. Cosmo Rand? Heard of him.
Loeffler&#8217;s got him in something. Who&#8217;s she?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Cora Boyle,&#8221; said the clerk and strolled
off to insult a messenger bringing in more flowers.</p>

<p>Mark had a curious, disheartening shock. He
didn&#8217;t bow to Cora Boyle on the street. What
right had she to send him flowers? It must be
a passing rudeness. She might remember that he
disliked pink roses. Mark rested on the ledge of
the box office, brooding. But she might mean to
be pleasant. Her manager, Loeffler, was on bad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
terms with Carlson. This might be a dictated,
indirect peace offering. Mark patted the florid
carved stone of the ledge and thought. Cora&#8217;s
new play wasn&#8217;t a success. The reviews had been
tart. She might be tired of Loeffler. Mark was
perplexed but the hunt for motives always
wearied him. A scarlet petticoat went by outside
the vestibule and led off his mind. He bade his
treasurer telephone for the motor and stood
joking with the man through the box office window
until a flat stop in the noise behind him made
Mark turn his head. The florists and clerks were
motionless, regarding the street. A coupé had
stopped. A footman was helping a woman and
a tumult of varied flowers to the sidewalk. She
came toward the doors gallantly, her face quite
hidden in the enormous bouquet but the treasurer
said, &#8220;By gee, I&#8217;d know her in hell, by her walk,&#8221;
and chuckled. She tripped on the sill and
screamed gaily to Mark, &#8220;Au s&#8217; cours!&#8221;</p>

<p>Mark jumped to catch the sheaf of yellow roses.
Miss Held waved her grey gloves wide and
dipped her chin. &#8220;Je t&#8217; apporte une gerbe vu que
t&#8217;es toujours bon enfant, Marc Antoine! And &#8217;ow
does Beatriz get along to teach you French?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pretty fair. Haven&#8217;t had much time lately.
Thought you&#8217;d taken your show on the road,
Anna?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nex&#8217; week.&#8221; Up the staircase some one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
began to whistle &#8220;La Petite Tonkinoise.&#8221; The
little woman vibrated inside the grey case of her
lacy gown and pursed her lips. &#8220;Oh, but I am
sick of that tune! Make him stop.&#8221; The
whistler heard and ceased. Miss Held swayed to
and fro among the flowers, noting cards. She
adopted a huge orchid for her waist and smiled
down at it. A dozen grins woke in the collecting
crowd. Mark was aware of upholsterers oozing
from the theatre. Miss Held hummed from
gift to gift, murmuring names&mdash;&#8220;Le Moyne....
ton institutrice.... Ce bon vieux David....
Nice lilies.&#8221; She moved in a succession of
swift steps that seemed balanced leaps. One of
the florist&#8217;s girls sighed a positive sob of envy.
The curving body and the embellished eyes kept
the crowd still. The soft gloves drooped on the
hard lustre of the stirring arms. Mark wondered
at her cool, sardonic mastery of attention. She
was bored, unwell and her frock was nothing new.
She was Anna Held and the people were edging
in from the sidewalk to look at her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Like to see the house, Anna?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no. I very well know what that would
be. All red, and gold fishes on the ceiling, eh?
No. I must go away.&#8221; She strolled off toward
her carriage, chattering sudden French which
Mark did not understand. He heard an immense
discussion surge up in the vestibule as he shut the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
coupé door, walked through it into the theatre
where two upholsterers were quarrelling over the
age of the paragon and where Mark bumped
against a man in brown who seemed to inspect
the gold dolphins of the vault.</p>

<p>&#8220;Clumsy,&#8221; said the man, briskly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t see you, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I meant the decoration.&#8221; The man flicked
a hand at the ceiling and the red boxes, &#8220;Like
Augustin Daly&#8217;s first house but much worse. We
should have passed that. Gilt. It&#8217;s the scortum
ante mortum in architecture.&#8221; He jammed a
cigarette between the straight lips of his flushed
face and went on in a rattle of dry syllables.
&#8220;Some one should write a monograph on gold
paint and the theatrical temperament. Plush
and passion. Stigmata.... Sous un balcon
doré.... Can you give me a match?...
Where&#8217;s Carlson&#8217;s office?&#8221; He bustled out of the
foyer.</p>

<p>Mark wearily tore Cora Boyle&#8217;s card in his
tanned fingers and nodded. The stranger was
right. This new theatre was stale. The gold
sparkled stupidly. The shades of velvet were
afflicting. But Carlson liked it. Mark sighed
and thought, rather sadly, that his patron&#8217;s whole
concept of the trade was vulgar and outworn like
this gaudy expense. Red velvet, heavy gold,
bright lamps&mdash;the trappings of his apprenticeship.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
Old actors told Mark that this was a variant of
the first Daly theatre. The stranger was right,
then. Mark wondered and went upstairs to the
office but the flushed man was gone.</p>

<p>&#8220;That feller Huneker was in tryin&#8217; to get me to
hire some orchestra leader,&#8221; Carlson said.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I thought Huneker was a young man,&#8221;
Mark answered.</p>

<p>Mr. Fitch whispered from his corner, &#8220;He
hasn&#8217;t any particular age. What was that riot
downstairs, Mark?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Anna Held dropped in and left some flowers.
She ain&#8217;t lookin&#8217; well.&#8221;</p>

<p>The playwright closed his magazine and lifted
himself from the chair, assuming his strange furry
hat. &#8220;We have just so much vitality. She&#8217;s
losing hers. But if she died tomorrow it would
make almost as much noise as killing a president.
And that&#8217;s quite right. Presidents never make
any one feel sinful. Good night.&#8221;</p>

<p>Carlson asked, &#8220;You&#8217;re comin&#8217; tonight, Clyde.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not feeling right, thanks.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mark followed the bent back down the stairs.
Fitch was stopped by a lounger at the doors,
loaned the old fellow ten dollars and passed, unobtrusive,
along Forty Fifth Street. He went
shadowlike in his vivid dress. Liking the man,
Mark frowned. The exhausted courtesy, the
slow voice always left him puzzled; it was as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
though the playwright&#8217;s prosperity kept within
it a dead core of something pained, as if the ghost
of an old hunger somehow lived on under the
coloured superfluity.</p>

<p>Mark&#8217;s motor arrived outside. He went to
whistle Gurdy up from an investigation of the
orchestra pit. All the bulbs burned about the
house. For a second Mark liked the place then
the gilt and the mulberry hangings bothered him.
He chased Gurdy up an aisle to the vestibule.
The treasurer slipped from the box office to say,
&#8220;Young Rand just called up. I said you wasn&#8217;t
here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Cora Boyle&#8217;s new husband. That English
kid.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mark shrugged and shoved Gurdy into the dull
blue limousine at the curb. The motor took him
away from the theatre and away from several
beckoning hands on the sidewalk. His shift to
managership had changed the fashion of salutes.
People now beckoned him with a posture of confidential
affection and earnestness. They had
friends to recommend, deep suggestions. Carlson
had warned him, &#8220;Mind, you&#8217;re a kid with a
pocketful of candy, now. You&#8217;ve stopped bein&#8217;
just one of the gang. Better ride in cabs if you
want to get anyplace.&#8221; Well, the motor, with its
adorable slippery blue crust, kept people at a distance.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
Mark wound an arm about Gurdy and
pulled himself into a corner of the seat. The car
was hampered by a dilatory van that lurched
ahead of its hood. The chauffeur cursed in Canadian
French and a messenger boy on the van&#8217;s
tail cursed back, joyously foul, emptily shooting
accusations of all sins in a sweet, sexless howl that
pierced the glass about Mark and made him grin,
absently amused.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s mad,&#8221; said Gurdy, dispassionately.</p>

<p>&#8220;No. He&#8217;s just talking, son.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Huh,&#8221; Gurdy grunted, trying to match the
words with ordinary conversation. This messenger
boy was plainly an accomplished fellow.
The van rolled off over Broadway in a shock of
light and dust. Gurdy saw &#8220;Red Winter&#8221; on a
poster and asked, &#8220;Is this Red Winter a good
play, Mark?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pretty fair, honey.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, can I come to it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Too dirty,&#8221; Mark said, then, &#8220;All about killin&#8217;
folks, son.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gurdy argued, &#8220;Well, Lohengrin&#8217;s all about
killing people and Miss Converse took me to that
and it was in Dutch.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;German, sonny.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I like French better&#8217;n German,&#8221; Gurdy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
yawned, waving a leg in the air and went on, &#8220;I
think Broadway&#8217;s ugly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re right,&#8221; said Mark, enchanted by such
taste.</p>

<p>Yet Carlson really liked to stroll on Broadway
and Cora Boyle had often led Mark for dusty
hours through this complexity of hesitant, garrulous
people, along these sidewalks where there
was nothing to be seen. He rubbed his jaw and
thought of Paris, viewed last summer, of the long,
swooping street at Winchester gilt in an afterglow.
Oh, after dark Broadway was tolerable!
Then the revolving people were shapes of no
consequence and, with a little mist, these lights
were aqueous, flotillas of shimmering points on
a hovering, uncertain vastness. Now, the roadway
was a dappled smear of bodies wheeled and
bodies shod. The sidewalks writhed, unseemly.
But Cora Boyle liked it. The pretty, black
haired dancer just then lodged at Mark&#8217;s cost
had rooms overlooking the new width above
Forty Second Street. And she liked that....
And she liked the scenery of &#8220;Red Winter.&#8221;
Poor stuff, he thought. He cursed scene painters.
Charles Frohman had heard of a fellow who&#8217;d
studied the art in Berlin and made astonishing
sets. He must telephone Frohman and get the
man&#8217;s name. He was tired. &#8220;Red Winter&#8221; had
tired him. The leading woman had a way of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
saying &#8220;California&#8221; through her nose that had
vexed him all week. A poor play. His head was
full of jagged swift ideas, of memories; Eddie
Bernamer milking a young cow against a sulphur
wall and laughing when Mark tried to sketch him
on the fly leaf of an algebra; Cora Boyle swaggering
into Rector&#8217;s in a blue dress; Clyde Fitch
telling little Margaret that her name was Margot;
Stanford White shouting with laughter because
Mark softened the ch of &#8220;architecture.&#8221;
Why hadn&#8217;t they given White a billion dollars
and let him build the whole city into charms of
tranquil, columnar symmetry?... Gurdy knew
that his uncle was oppressed. When Mark
thought hard he stroked the scar on his jaw.
Gurdy wanted to talk, now, and tossed a leg over
Mark&#8217;s black, rocky knee.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;re you thinkin&#8217; about, Mark?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just bosh. What&#8217;s Margot been doing all
day?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Havin&#8217; a bellyache.&#8221;</p>

<p>That terrified Mark. He sweated suddenly
and called through the tube bidding the driver
hurry. Spinal meningitis, he read, began with
nausea. But when he ran into the panelled
library of his house Margot was playing with her
largest doll and the angular governess assured
him, in simple French, that a pill had set things
right. Margot lifted her black eyes and said,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
rubbing her stomach, &#8220;I was ill, papa,&#8221; in her
leisurely way.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ate breakfast too fast,&#8221; Gurdy said, in grim
displeasure, watching Mark double his lean height
and begin to cuddle Margot.</p>

<p>Margot stared at her cousin with an aggrieved,
brief pout and then wound herself into Mark&#8217;s
lap. The large doll was named Aunt Sadie for
Mrs. Bernamer. Margot said, &#8220;Miss Converse
fixed Aunt Sadie&#8217;s drawers, papa,&#8221; and her brown
face rippled as she displayed three stitches.
Then she righted the doll and gazed at Mark
devotedly, solemnly, preening her starched skirt
of pink linen. Pink went with her black hair and
her tawny skin. Mark touched a roaming mesh
of her hair and her face rippled once more. Her
skin had this amber haze like the water of a pool
in the pine forest behind the farm. In that pool
he had bathed with her father through endless
afternoons, idling on until other boys lagged off
and the shadows were ink on the crumbled ocher
clay of the margin where pink boneset grew.
And now Joe was dead and his blackhaired wife
was dead ... an unskilled cook before marriage,
half Irish, half Italian, a good, sleepy
woman who ate with her knife and wore a chaplet
blessed for her Roman mother by some Pope.
Margot would never know them. He kissed her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
hair. She was this warm bubble enclosed in his
arms.</p>

<p>&#8220;Love me any, sister?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Course,&#8221; said Margot.</p>

<p>Gurdy snorted and stalked away. Mark
talked to the stiff governess and patted Margot.
Miss Converse sewed and chatted about Conrad&#8217;s
novels, then getting fashionable. She assented,
&#8220;Very interesting. Romantic, of course. I dare
say the colour attracts you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; said Mark, &#8220;and what if they are
romantic?&#8221;</p>

<p>She had some vague objection. If she bored
him, Mark was still grateful that she hadn&#8217;t tried
to marry him. She was necessary to the training
of the children but her buff, bulky face wasn&#8217;t
alluring and her gowns hurt him by a prevalence
of mole embroidery and rumpled lace. She was
a gentlewoman, wonderfully learned and obliging
about his pet airs on the piano. Mark talked
and wished that he could escape, like Gurdy who
went to practice handsprings in the white hall and
slid downstairs at the note of the doorbell.</p>

<p>Gurdy slid along the handrail of black wood
so admired by callers and jumped for the dining
room which had doors of glass coated in blue
silk. These doors opened into the drawing room
which Gurdy despised for its furniture all black<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
and silver and its hangings of cloudy tapestry,
impossibly noiseless when one bounced balls
against them. Yet people called it a lovely room.
And now, peering through a rift of the blue silk
Gurdy saw the butler turn a visitor into this
space and the visitor looked about with brown
eyes, seeming to admire. Gurdy speculated and
decided that the slight man was an actor come to
talk to Mark about a part. His hair curled, his
overcoat clung to his middle neatly, his white
gaiters were unspotted, his pale moustache didn&#8217;t
overhang his little mouth. He was visibly an
actor. Gurdy had examined many through this
spyhole. And like many the fellow went to
glance at a circular mirror above the cabinet with
tiny doors which Miss Converse called &#8220;Siennese.&#8221;
As Mark&#8217;s feet descended, the man
straightened himself and began a smile. Gurdy
listened to the jar of his high voice against Mark&#8217;s
fuller drawl.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Rand?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. Don&#8217;t think we&#8217;ve ever met. Daresay
you know who I am and all that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Mark.</p>

<p>Gurdy noted the long pause. He held that
actors were a talkative lot. Mr. Rand worked
with his moustache an indefinite time before he
spoke again.</p>

<p>&#8220;My wife sent me along&mdash;I&#8217;m a sort of ambassador,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
you know?... Matter of business,
entirely.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mark said, &#8220;I see,&#8221; wondering how old the
man was. The moustache had an appearance
of soft youth. He smiled, wanting Cora&#8217;s third
husband to be at ease, and nodded to a chair.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, thanks no. Mrs. Rand wants to know if
you&#8217;d mind meeting her. At her hotel, for instance?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t mind at all,&#8221; Mark lied, &#8220;Glad to.
Any time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then she may let you know? Thanks ever
so. Good luck to your play tonight,&#8221; said the
young man and walked out gracefully.</p>

<p>Gurdy came through the glass doors and asked,
&#8220;Who&#8217;s he?&#8221; Mark lifted the pliant, hard body
in the air. He fancied that Gurdy must feel
something odd, here.</p>

<p>&#8220;How old would you say he was, darling?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dunno. Who&#8217;s Mrs. Rand?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;An actress.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Put me down,&#8221; said Gurdy, &#8220;My pants are
comin&#8217; off.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mark breathed comfortably, helped the boy on
his knee tighten the white trousers and passed into
dotage. Eddie Bernamer and Joe Walling had
begotten these bodies. The fact mattered nothing.
Mark was a father. He had possession.
When things went wrong he could come home to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
gloat over Margot and Gurdy. He promised,
&#8220;I shan&#8217;t be busy now for a week. We&#8217;ll ride
in the Park and feed the squirrels, sonny.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right. Say, Mark, you&#8217;re all thin.&mdash;There&#8217;s
the doorbell, again.&mdash;Oh, say, a lady
telephoned s&#8217;noon. Her name was Miss Monroe
and she wanted you to call her up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I like her nerve!&#8221;</p>

<p>Gurdy jumped at this loud snort of his uncle.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s she?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s an actress,&#8221; Mark stammered, hoping
the boy wouldn&#8217;t go on, and Carlson came in, his
yellow face splotched as though he&#8217;d been walking
fast.</p>

<p>&#8220;That Rand squirt been here?&#8221; he yelled at
Mark.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. Why?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I passed him. What&#8217;s he want?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Me to meet her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You goin&#8217; to?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Guess I better, Mr. Carlson.&#8221;</p>

<p>Carlson jabbed Gurdy&#8217;s stomach with his cane
and panted, &#8220;I can tell you what she wants and
don&#8217;t you listen to it, neither. She&#8217;s had a fight
with Billy Loeffler. He won&#8217;t put this whelp she
married in her comp&#8217;ny. I bet she quits Loeffler.
Her show&#8217;s no good, anyhow. Well, I won&#8217;t
take her on. She&#8217;s a second rater. She&#8217;s an
onion. I won&#8217;t have her for nothin&#8217;. Don&#8217;t you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
get sentymental about Cora Boyle any more, son!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You needn&#8217;t worry,&#8221; said Mark, patting
Gurdy&#8217;s ear.</p>

<p>Gurdy sat up and inquired, &#8220;Is that the Cora
Boyle grandpapa says was a loose footed heifer?&#8221;
So Carlson broke into screaming mirth. Mark
flushed and mumbled, sent the boy away and
scowled respectfully at his partner. Sometimes
Carlson&#8217;s crude amusement stung him.</p>

<p>&#8220;For God&#8217;s sake don&#8217;t talk of her in front of
the kids, sir!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, son. Goin&#8217; to let Gurdy come to
the show tonight?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not much!&#8221;</p>

<p>The old man lounged into a chair and jeered at
his fosterling. Mark&#8217;s horror diverted him.
He yapped, &#8220;Still think it&#8217;s a dirty show, do
you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.... Oh, dunno! If there was anything
to the slop but that second act, I wouldn&#8217;t
care. Nothing but Sappho over again. Old as
the hills.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s new in the show business, son?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Merry Widow is,&#8221; Mark laughed, &#8220;and
you wouldn&#8217;t buy it. Savage is bringing it in
week after next. They were playing the music
at Rector&#8217;s last night.&mdash;Look here, the set for
the last act&#8217;s all wrong, still. Those green
curtains&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>&#8220;You and your sets! God,&#8221; said Carlson,
&#8220;you&#8217;d ought to&#8217;ve been a scene painter!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish I could be, for about one week!&#8221;
Mark let a grievance loose, slapping his leg.
&#8220;These people make me sick! You tell them you
want something new and they trot out some
sketch of a room that every one&#8217;s seen for twenty
years. They never think of&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You ain&#8217;t ever satisfied! You act like
scenery made a show&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Mark sighed, &#8220;Well, we&#8217;re not giving the
public its moneysworth with this piece. The
scenery&#8217;s&mdash;mediocre.&mdash;Come up and see Margot.&#8221;</p>

<p>The old man poked Margot&#8217;s doll with a shaking
thumb and called her Maggie to see her scowl,
like Mark. The little girl&#8217;s solemn vanity
delighted him. He was also delighted by Gurdy
who became an embodied sneer when Mark
fondled Margot. The boy watched Mark kiss
this female nuisance then walked haughtily out
of the library and set to work banging the piano
in the upper playroom.</p>

<p>&#8220;All you need&#8217;s a wife and a mother-in-law and
you&#8217;d have a happy home,&#8221; Carlson said when
Mark let him out of the front door.</p>

<p>&#8220;Think I haven&#8217;t?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I suppose you have. Ain&#8217;t any truth in this
that you&#8217;re goin&#8217; to marry that Monroe gal?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>&#8220;No. I gave her a ring, last week. I suppose
she&#8217;s been airing it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure.&mdash;You big calf,&#8221; the old man said with
gloom, &#8220;you always act so kind of surprised when
one of &#8217;em brags of you. You ain&#8217;t but twenty-nine
and you&#8217;re a fine lookin&#8217; jackass. Of course,
she&#8217;ll show off her solytaire! A gal&#8217;s as vain as
a man, any day. One of &#8217;em&#8217;ll get you married,
yet.&mdash;Yell at that cab, son. My legs are mighty
tired.&mdash;See you at eight sharp. Now, mind, I
won&#8217;t have nothin&#8217; to say to Cora Boyle.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mark waited until the opening night of &#8220;The
Merry Widow&#8221; for more news of Cora Boyle.
She deserted her manager, Loeffler, while &#8220;Red
Winter&#8221; was in the first week of its run at the
45th Street Theatre. Mark saw her lunching in
the Knickerbocker grill with her young husband
and a critic who always touted her as the successor
of Ada Rehan. A busybody assured Mark that
Cosmo Rand was twenty. Cora was thirty one.
All three of her husbands, then, were younger.
The oddity of theatrical marriage still alarmed
Mark. In Fayettesville it was a fixed convention
that girls should be younger than their husbands.
But she was luscious to see at the &#8220;Merry Widow&#8221;
opening. Mark thought how well she looked,
hung above the crowd in the green lined box.
She found novel fashions of massing her hair.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
That night it rose in a black peak sustained by
silver combs. She kept a yellow cloak slung
across one bare shoulder concealing her gown.
Against the gentle green of her background appeared
three men. Rand wore a single eye-glass
that sparkled dully when the outer lights were
low. Through the music and the applause Mark
was conscious of the box and of Cora&#8217;s red
feathered fan. Her second husband, a thin
Jewish comedian, went up to shake hands in an
entr&#8217;acte. Women behind Mark giggled wildly.
He wandered into the bronze lobby where men
were already whistling the slow melody of
&#8220;Velia.&#8221; He was chaffed by an Irish actor
manager born in Chicago whose accent was a
triumph of maintained vowels.</p>

<p>&#8220;An&#8217; why don&#8217;t you go shake hands with Cora,
bhoy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shut up, Terry. Come have a drink?&#8221;</p>

<p>He steered his friend to a new bar. The Irishman
was rather drunk but vastly genial. He
maundered, &#8220;A fool Cora was to let go of you,
bhoy. They&#8217;re tellin&#8217; me you&#8217;ve made money in
the stockmarket, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A little,&#8221; Mark admitted.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve had no luck that way. Well, a fool Cora
was.&mdash;And how&#8217;s it feel bein&#8217; a manager, lad?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fine.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Irishman looked at Mark sidelong over his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
glass, then up at the gold stars of the ceiling.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ho!&mdash;Yes, it&#8217;s a fine feelin&#8217;.&mdash;Well, wait until
you&#8217;ve put on a couple of frosts, bhoy! And have
to go hat in your hand huntin&#8217; a backer. You lend
money, easy.&mdash;You&#8217;ll see all the barflies that&#8217;ve
had their ten and their twenty off you time and
again&mdash;You&#8217;ll see &#8217;em run when they see you
comin&#8217;. Well, here tonight and hell tomorrow.&mdash;So
Cora&#8217;s quit Billy Loeffler, has she? The dhear
man! May his children all be acrobats! &#8217;Twas
Gus Daly taught the scut every trick he knows.
The Napoleon of Broadway! I mind Loeffler
runnin&#8217; err&#8217;nds for Daly in eighty five.&mdash;Well, you
wanted to be a manager and here you are and
here&#8217;s luck.&mdash;It&#8217;s a fine game&mdash;the finest there
is&mdash;and, mind you, I&#8217;ve been a practicin&#8217; bhurglar
and a plumber. Drink up.&#8221;</p>

<p>They drank and returned to the green theatre,
resonant with the prelude of the next act. Mark
was struggling in the half lit thresh of men strolling
toward their seats when Cosmo Rand halted
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d not mind coming to supper in our rooms
at the Knickbocker?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mark accepted. The scene of the Maxim revel
was lost to him while he wondered what Cora
wanted. He wouldn&#8217;t engage her. Carlson&#8217;s
prejudice was probably valid. The old man swore
that she was worthless outside light comedy. Yet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
she had good notices in all her parts. She was
famous for clothes. She signed recommendations
for silks and unguents. She had made a
dressmaker popular among actresses. She had
played in a failure in London whence came legends
of a passionate Duke. The Duke&#8217;s passion might
be invented, like other legends. He mused.
The flowing waltz music made him melancholy.
What sort of woman was Cora, nowadays?
Every one changed. He, himself, had changed.
He was getting callous to ready amities, explosions
of mean jealousy. He knew nothing of Cora,
really. She might be a different person, better
tempered, less frank. Women were incomprehensible,
anyhow. He would never understand
them, doubted that anyone did and sighed. He
walked to Cora&#8217;s hotel with a feeling of great
dignity. She had mauled him badly, abused him,
lied to him and now she was seeking peace.
Then, rising in the lift, he knew that this dignity
had a hollow heart; he was afraid of Cora Boyle.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is awfully good of you,&#8221; she said, shaking
hands. Then she rested one arm on the
shelf filled with flowers and smiled slowly,
theatrically, kicking her rosy train into the right
swath about her feet. Mark felt the display as a
boast of her body. She resumed, &#8220;There&#8217;s really
no sense in our looking at each other over a fence,
is there?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>His face, seen in a mirror among the flowers,
cheered Mark to a grin. He looked impassive
and bland. He drawled, &#8220;No sense at all,&#8221; and
stepped back. But she confused him. He had
to speak. He said, &#8220;That&#8217;s a stunning frock.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You always did notice clothes, didn&#8217;t you?
Cosmo, do give Mr. Walling a drink.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her voice had rounded and came crisply with
an English hint. But it was not music. It
jangled badly against Rand&#8217;s level, &#8220;What&#8217;ll you
have, sir?&#8221; from the table where there were
bottles and plates of sandwiches. Mark considered
this boy as they talked of &#8220;The Merry
Widow.&#8221; He saw man&#8217;s beauty inexpertly
enough. Young Rand was handsome in the
fragile, groomed manner of an English illustration.
His chin was pointed. His eyes seemed
brown. His curls lay in even bands. He had
neither length nor strength. But he talked
sensibly, rather shrewdly.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;ll be a deal of money lost bringing
over Viennese pieces, of course. This thing&#8217;s one
in a thousand. Quite charming.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mark asked, &#8220;You&#8217;ve not been over here long?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I?&#8221; Rand laughed, &#8220;Lord, yes. I&#8217;m a
Canadian. Born in Iowa, as a matter of fact.
I&#8217;ve been a good deal in England, of course.&mdash;Oh,
I was at your new piece the other night. Red
Winter, I mean. How very nicely you&#8217;ve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
mounted it. I really felt beastly cold in that
second act. The snow&#8217;s so good.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mark bowed, selecting a sandwich. The critics
had praised the snow scene. Rand might truly
admire it. If the snow hadn&#8217;t satisfied Mark it
had pleased every one else. He lost himself in
thoughts of snow. Cora trailed her rose gown
to the table and poured water into a glass of pale
wine. A broad bracelet on her wrist clicked
against the glass. She said, &#8220;You and Carlson
own all the rights to Red Winter, don&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you going to send it to London?&#8221;</p>

<p>He laughed and put down his glass. &#8220;London?
What for? It&#8217;d last just about one week!&#8221;</p>

<p>Cora smiled over a shoulder, retiring to the
shelf of flowers.</p>

<p>&#8220;It would do better than that, Mark. I&#8217;ve
played in London.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve never played there but I&#8217;ve been there
enough to know better. California Gold Rush!
They don&#8217;t know there was such a thing!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I say,&#8221; said Rand.</p>

<p>Cora sipped some watered wine. The light
shot through the glass and made a pear of glow
on her throat. She was motionless, drinking. She
became a shape set separate from the world in a
momentary gleam. He knew that she was acting.
Then she said sharply, &#8220;I&#8217;ll buy the English rights<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
if you and Carlson&#8217;ll make me a decent figure.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, look here! You&#8217;d lose. I was talking
to Ian Gail about it, last night. It wouldn&#8217;t
make a cent in England. They wouldn&#8217;t know
what it&#8217;s all about. And&mdash;it&#8217;s such a rotten play!
There&#8217;s nothing in it!&#8221;</p>

<p>She asked, looking at him, &#8220;Can I have it?&#8221;
and her flat voice took fire in the question, achieved
music. She must want the poor play badly.
Rand&#8217;s pink nails were lined along his moustache,
hiding its silk. The room fell silent.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, sure,&#8221; Mark said, &#8220;You can have it, Cora.
I&#8217;ll see Mr. Carlson in the morning.... But
damned if I can make out what there is in the
play.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not the sort of thing you like, I know.
But I&#8217;m sick of comedy and that&#8217;s all I&#8217;m ever
offered, here. And I&#8217;m sick of New York.
Well, make me an offer of the English rights&mdash;Only&mdash;I&#8217;m
no bank, Mark.&#8221; She swaggered to
the piano and tamely played a few bars of the
Merry Widow waltz. She hadn&#8217;t Olive Ilden&#8217;s
grace, so seated, and the rose gown seemed sallow
against the black of the piano. She had finished
her scene. Mark saw the familiar stir of her
throat as she hid a yawn. He promised to hurry
the business of the English rights to the melodrama
and took his leave.</p>

<p>What had he feared? He tried to think, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
the corridor. Recapture, perhaps, by this woman
who wasn&#8217;t, after all, half as wicked as others.
Her new elegance hadn&#8217;t moved him. The stage
did refine people! Cora had the full air of
celebrity. She was now controlled, vainer. She
might still be a shrew. He saddened, ringing for
the lift, and thought of Cosmo Rand&#8217;s future if
&#8220;Red Winter&#8221; failed in London. The elevator
deposited a page with a silver bucket and this went
clinking to Cora&#8217;s door. Rand and she would
drink champagne. Mark sank pondering to the
lounge and stopped to buy a cigar, there. It was
almost one o&#8217;clock. Many of the lights had been
turned out. The threaded marble lost sheen in
the smoky gloom. Parties ebbed from the
supper room and a wedge of dressed men waved
to Mark. A candy merchant in the lead bawled
to him and Mark went to be introduced to an
English actress on the millionaire&#8217;s arm. She
swayed, gracious and tipsy, involved in a cloak of
jet velvet, her voice murmurous as brushed harp
strings emerging from the pallor of her face above
the browning gardenias on the cloak. She asked,
&#8220;Like this wrap? Makes me feel like a very big
black cigar&mdash;I should have a very broad red and
gold band.&#8221; The men pressed about her fame
sniggered, respecting this lovely myth. She was
assigned in legend to the desire of princes. The
candy merchant grinned, cuddling her hand on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
his waistcoat. She tapped the brass edge of the
turning door with a gardenia stem and smiled
at Mark&#8217;s silk hat, then at the millionaire. &#8220;Am
I talking too loud, cherished one?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shout your head off,&#8221; the candy merchant
said, &#8220;It&#8217;s a free country.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, only the bond are free,&#8221; she proclaimed.
She told Mark, &#8220;Bond Street&#8217;s getting frightfully
shabby. Max Beerbohm says&mdash;I do look rather
like a very big black cigar, don&#8217;t I?&mdash;Do stop
pulling my arm, you dear, fat thing!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The car&#8217;s here, honey.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How dear of the car! We&#8217;re going to sup
somewhere, aren&#8217;t we? Oh, no, to bed.&mdash;Like
a very big, black cigar&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>She was drawn through the brazen doors away
from Mark. The men pushed after her avidly.
She went tottering to the great motor, was engulfed.
Mark blinked in the waning smell of
gardenias, waited for the motor to be gone and
walked into the street. He saw rain falling.
There was no taxicab in sight along the street.
From the west an orange palpitation flooded this
darker way. Steam from a clamorous drill blew
north about the white tower of the Times building.
Wet cabs jerked north and south along the
gleam of rails. The higher lights were gone.
The rain dropped from an upper purple and
rapped the crown of his hat as Mark strolled to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
the corner. Some one began to talk to him before
he reached Broadway. Mark glanced at this
beggar carelessly and paused to dig in a pocket
for change. The shivering voice continued.</p>

<p>&#8220;... ain&#8217;t like I&#8217;d come bothering you before.
I ain&#8217;t that kind. But you&#8217;ve got comp&#8217;nies on
the road and honest, Walling, I&#8217;m as good as ever
I was. You&#8217;ve mebbe heard that I&#8217;m taking dope.
Not so. Some of that bunch at Bill Loeffler&#8217;s
office have been puttin&#8217; that out. Honest&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Three white capped young sailors blundered
past, all laughing, and jarred the shadowy body
away from Mark. The man came shuffling back
and clung to Mark&#8217;s sleeve, his face lavender in
the rainy light above a shapeless overcoat. He
whispered on, &#8220;Honest, some of the things that
bunch at Loeffler&#8217;s place say about you and Carlson!
But I ain&#8217;t takin&#8217; nothing, Walling. Had
a run of bad luck. I&#8217;m on the rocks. But you&#8217;ve
seen me run a show. You know I can handle a
comp&#8217;ny&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The light&#8217;s so bad,&#8221; said Mark, &#8220;and your
collar&mdash;I&#8217;m not just sure who&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>The man gave a whimpering laugh. &#8220;Oh, I
thought you was actin&#8217; kind of chilly to an old
pal. I&#8217;m Jim Rothenstein. You know? I was
stage manager for Carlson back when you was
playin&#8217; the kid in Nicoline. You know. I gave
you your job. Cora Boyle she brought you in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
to me and asked if there wasn&#8217;t a little part&mdash;Honest,
I ain&#8217;t takin&#8217; dope. That bunch&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Mark gulped, &#8220;Of course you&#8217;re not.&#8221; Some
harsh drug escaped from the man&#8217;s rags. This
was nightmare. Mark found a bill and held it
out, backing from the shadow. &#8220;Come round to
my office some day and I&#8217;ll see what&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>A hansom rolled to the curb and the driver
raised his whip. Mark ran to shelter, crying his
address. The grey horse moved toward Broadway.
Mark shoved up the trap and shouted to
the driver, &#8220;No! Go up Fifth Avenue!&#8221;</p>

<p class="drop-cap">CORA BOYLE played &#8220;Red Winter&#8221; in
London for two years. She began her
run in May of 1908 with a popular
English male star as her hero. He presently retired
from the company and Cosmo Rand replaced
him. Olive Ilden wrote an opinion to Mark from
her new house in Chelsea: &#8220;It seems to me that
your one time wife is a competent second rate
actress. She&mdash;or someone near her&mdash;must have
intelligence. She has perfectly applied our
musical comedy manner to melodrama. She is
languid and rude to the audience and is enormously,
successful, naturally. Ambrose Russell is
painting her. If you knew London you would
understand that to have Ambrose Russell paint
one implies entire success. He alternates Gaiety
girls and Duchesses and has acquired a trick of
wonderful vulgarity. I met Miss Boyle at his
studio on Sunday. We talked about you and she
rather gushed. Her infantile husband stood by
and said Rawther at intervals like an automatic
figure on a clock. A pretty thing.... Of
course I prefer London to Winchester. Ecclesiastical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
society is only amusing in Trollope. My
husband got our house from a retired Admiral
and it has a garden. I have fallen in love with
him&mdash;my husband, not the Admiral. He has
written a book of Naval tales on the sly and to
my horror they are quite good. Having scorned
him as a mere gentleman all these years it upsets
me to have to consider him as an artist. I hear
from Ian Gail that your plays all make quantities
of money because they are utter rubbish in lovely
settings and that your house is an upholsterer&#8217;s
paradise. Very bad for the children who are
probably spoiled beyond hope or help.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mark wrote four pages of denial and received:
&#8220;Nonsense! Of course you do not have
courtesans to lunch but leading ladies come and
swoon on your drawing room floor and the
children are pointed out in your Central Park as
Mark Walling&#8217;s brats. Your parasites fawn on
them. Their world is made up of expensive
motors, sweets and an adoring idiot as God. The
little boy reads theatrical reviews over his porridge
and the little girl probably does not know
that she is a mammal and liable to death, spanking
or lessons. They live in a treacle well....
Your one time wife has taken a house near me and
her pictures, eating breakfast in bed with a Pom
on the pillow, adorn the Sketch. I danced with
her husband last night.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>Cora Boyle&#8217;s photographs in the London
Weeklies made old Carlson sneer. He lounged
in Mark&#8217;s library and derided: &#8220;A fine figger and
a pair of black eyes. Actress? Sure. She
makes pictures of herself. And what the hell else
do folks want, huh? Just that. They want
pictures. You say they want fine scenery and new
ideas about lights and all? Bosh, son! They
want to see a good lookin&#8217; gal in good clothes&mdash;and
not much clothes&mdash;with all the lights in the
house jammed on her. Act? Make &#8217;em cry a
little and they think it&#8217;s actin&#8217;. Margot&#8217;ll be the
boss actress of the United States when she&#8217;s
twenty&mdash;Come here, Maggie, and tell me how old
you are.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Seven and a half,&#8221; said Margot, &#8220;and I don&#8217;t
want to be an actress.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Huh. Why not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Aunt Sadie says actresses aren&#8217;t nice,&#8221; Margot
informed him.</p>

<p>Carlson wrinkled his yellow face and chuckled
out, &#8220;Ask Mark what he thinks of &#8217;em, sister.&#8221;</p>

<p>She turned her eyes up to Mark gravely and
smiled. She was unlike her father, most like her
mother. Mark bent and lifted her in the air,
kissed her bare knees and put her hair aside from
the little ears, faintly red, delightfully chilled
for his mouth from a walk in the Park. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
said, on his shoulder, &#8220;Oo, that&#8217;s a new stickpin,
papa!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Diamonds get &#8217;em all,&#8221; Carlson nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a sapphire,&#8221; said Mark.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nice,&#8221; Margot approved and Mark felt
glorified. Children were certainly a relief after
the arid nonchalance of women who took money,
jewels or good rôles and asked for more donations
over the house telephone. Margot played
with the sapphire square a moment and then
scrambled down from Mark&#8217;s shoulder to his knee
where she sat admiring him while he wrote checks.
He smiled at her now and then, let her blot
signatures and kissed her hands when she did so.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d spoil a trick elephant,&#8221; Carlson muttered,
&#8220;Ain&#8217;t Gurdy old enough to go to school?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He started in at Doctor Cary&#8217;s last week.
They&#8217;ve got him learning Latin and French, right
off.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s Doctor Cary&#8217;s?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a school in Sixtieth Street.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hump,&#8221; said Carlson, &#8220;Private School?
Well, you&#8217;re right. Public schools teach hogwash.
They got to. They teach hogs. But
why didn&#8217;t you send him to one these schools out
of town while you were at it? Get him out of
New York.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My G&mdash;glory,&#8221; Mark cried, &#8220;He&#8217;s only nine!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>Margot corrected, &#8220;Ten, papa. He was ten
in May.&#8221; Then she told Carlson, &#8220;Papa&#8217;d just
die if Gurdy went away to school. He told Miss
Converse.&#8221; She slid from his knee and curtsied
to Carlson with, &#8220;I must take my French lesson,
now. So, good afternoon.&#8221; She was gone
out of the room before Mark could kiss her again.
She was always within reach of kisses and her
warmth, curled on his lap was something consolatory
when he did send Gurdy away to Saint
Andrew&#8217;s School in September 1910. Villay, his
broker, and his lawyer advised the step. Olive
Ilden wrote to him: &#8220;I am glad you have done the
right thing. God knows I am no cryer up of the
Public School System. But a Public School (I
forget what you call private kennels for rich cubs
in the States) is the only thing for the boy, in
your situation. Ian Gail tells me that Gurdy is
rather clever. I can imagine nothing worse than
to be the son by adoption of a theatrical manager
and a day scholar at a small New York school.
But I know how miserable you are. Every one
has sentimental accretions. I dislike seeing old
women run down by motors, myself. No, I know
how badly you feel, just now. But these be the
fair rewards of them that love, you know? My
own son is, of course, as the archangels. I hear
through his Housemaster at Harrow that he
smokes cigarettes and bets on all the races.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>Mark tried to take Gurdy&#8217;s absence with a fine
philosophy. His broker and his lawyer assured
him that Saint Andrew&#8217;s was the best school in the
country. But the red, Georgian buildings spread
on the New England meadow and the impersonal
stateliness of the lean Headmaster seemed a cold
nest for Gurdy. He missed the boy with a dry
and aching pain that wasn&#8217;t curable by work on
five new plays, Margot&#8217;s plump warmth on his
knee or contrived, brief intoxication. All his
usual enchantments failed. He wore out the
phonograph plates of the Danse Macabre and
the Peer Gynt &#8220;Sunrise.&#8221; He worried wretchedly
and the disasters of October and November
hardly balanced his interior trouble. Two, the
more expensive two of the five Carlson and
Walling productions failed. Carlson cheerfully
indicated the shrinkage of applicants for jobs,
hopeful playwrights and performers in the office
above the 45th Street Theatre. Mark regretted
twenty thousand dollars spent for shares in the
Terriss Pictograph Company. Yet young Terriss
was a keen fellow and Carlson thought something
might come of motion pictures after a while.
His friends sighed about Mark that the &#8220;show
business was a gamble&#8221; and on visits to the farm
Mark tried to be gay. A Military Academy had
been built in Fayettesville on a stony field owned
by Eddie Bernamer, the only heritage from Bernamer&#8217;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
Norwegian father. Gurdy&#8217;s brothers
were transferred to this polished school and Mark
was soothed, in thinking that he&#8217;d made his own
people grandees. He wished that he could ape
the composure of the Bernamers and said so on a
visit near Christmas time.</p>

<p>&#8220;But, great Cæsar,&#8221; Bernamer blinked, kicking
balled snow from a boot-heel, &#8220;this Saint
Andrew&#8217;s is a good school ain&#8217;t it, even if it is
up by Boston? The buildin&#8217;s are fire proof, ain&#8217;t
they? Gurdy can&#8217;t git out at night and raise
Ned? Then what&#8217;s got into you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, but&mdash;my God, Eddie!... I miss him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a fool,&#8221; said his brother-in-law, staring
at Mark, &#8220;You&#8217;re doin&#8217; the right thing by the boy.
You always do the right thing&mdash;like you done it
by us. Sadie and me&#8217;ve got seven kids and I love
&#8217;em all.... They got to grow up. Stop bein&#8217;
a fool.... You don&#8217;t look well. Thin&#8217;s a
rail. Business bad?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We lost about forty-five thousand in two
months.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That countin&#8217; in the thousand you gave Sadie
for her birthday?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No&mdash;Lord, no!&#8221;</p>

<p>Bernamer looked about the increased, wide
farm and the tin roofed garage where Mark&#8217;s
blue motor stood pompous beside the cheap family
machine. He drawled, &#8220;Well, you&#8217;ve sunk about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
twenty-five thousand right here, bud. You let
up on us. Save your money and set up that
theatre of your own you want so. And I&#8217;m
makin&#8217; some money on the side.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How?&#8221;</p>

<p>The farmer grinned.</p>

<p>&#8220;That no good Healy boy&mdash;Margot&#8217;s mamma&#8217;s
cousin, come soft soapin&#8217; round for a loan last
summer. He and another feller have a kind of
music hall place in Trenton. A couple of girls
that sing and one of those movin&#8217; picsher
machines. They wanted five hundred to put in
more chairs. I fixed it I&#8217;d get a tenth the profit
and they&#8217;ve been sendin&#8217; me twenty-five and thirty
dollars a week ever since&mdash;and prob&#8217;ly cheatin&#8217;
the eye teeth out of me. Dunno what folks go
to the place for&mdash;but they do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Funny,&#8221; said Mark.</p>

<p>A bugle blew in the grey bulk of the Military
Academy. Boys came threading out across the
flat snow between ice girt tree trunks. A triple
rank formed below the quivering height of the
flagpole where the wind afflicted the banner.
The minute shimmer of brass on the blue uniforms
thrilled Mark. The flag rippled down in folds
of a momentary beauty. He sighed and turned
back to the pink papered living room where
Gurdy&#8217;s small, fat legged sisters were clotted
around Margot&#8217;s rosy velvet on a leather lounge.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
Old Walling smoked a sickening cheroot and
smiled at all this prettiness. Margot&#8217;s black
hair was curled expansively by the damp air. She
sat regally, telling her country cousins of Mastin&#8217;s
shop where Mark bought her clothes. She
kissed every one good-bye when Mark&#8217;s driver
steered the car to the door and told Eddie Bernamer
how well his furred moleskin jacket suited
him. In the limousine she stretched her bright
pumps on the footwarmer beside Mark&#8217;s feet
and said, &#8220;Oh, you&#8217;ve some colour, now, papa!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have I? Cold air. D&#8217;you know you say
na-ow and ca-ow, daughter, just like you lived on
the farm the year &#8217;round?&#8221;</p>

<p>Margot gave her queer, chiming chuckle which
was like muffled Chinese bells. &#8220;Do I?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pure New Jersey, honey. I used to. Mrs.
Le Moyne used to guy me about it when I was a
kid.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Converse says &#8216;guy&#8217; is slang,&#8221; Margot
murmured.</p>

<p>&#8220;So it is, sister. We ought to go to England
some summer pretty soon and let Miss Converse
visit her folks.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d love to.... I&#8217;ve never been abroad,&#8221; she
said, gravely stating it as though Mark mightn&#8217;t
know, &#8220;And every one goes abroad, don&#8217;t they?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And what would you do abroad?&#8221;</p>

<p>She considered one pump and fretted the silver<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
buckle with the other heel. &#8220;I&#8217;d see people,
papa.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What people, sis?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; she said, &#8220;every one!&#8221;</p>

<p>It set him thinking that she lived pent in
his house with her stiff, alien governess. She was
infinitely safe, so, but she might be bored; he
recalled hot and stagnant evenings on the farm
when his mind had floated free of the porch
steps and his father&#8217;s drawl into a paradise of
black haired nymphs and illustrious warriors
dressed from the engravings of the Centennial
Shakespeare. Perhaps she should go to school?
He consulted the governess, was surprised by her
agreement, began to ask questions about schools
for small girls.</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Thorne&#8217;s,&#8221; said his broker, Villay,
&#8220;She&#8217;ll really be taught something there....
Miss Thorne was my wife&#8217;s governess. I&#8217;ll see
if I can manage....&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Manage what?&#8221;</p>

<p>The broker clicked his cigarette case open, shut
it and laughed, &#8220;You know what I mean,
Walling.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was one thing getting Gurdy into Saint
Andrew&#8217;s. The Headmaster&#8217;s a broad minded
man.... My dear boy, you&#8217;re Walling&mdash;Walling,
of Carlson and Walling and you used to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
a matinée idol.... I don&#8217;t like hurting your
feelings.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean you&#8217;ll have to go down on your
knees to this Miss Thorne to get her to take
Margot?&#8221;</p>

<p>The broker said, &#8220;Not exactly down on my
knees, Walling. I&#8217;ll have it managed. The
school&#8217;s a corporation and my wife owns some
stock.&#8221; Mark groaned and was driven uptown
thinking sourly of New York. Things like this
made Socialists, he fancied, and looked with
sympathy at an orator on a box in Union Square.
But Gurdy was arriving by the five o&#8217;clock train
at the Grand Central Station and the lush swirl
of the crowd on Fifth Avenue cured Mark&#8217;s
spleen. Snow fluttered in planes of brief opal
from the depth of assorted cornices above the
exciting lights. A scarlet car crossed his at
Thirty Fourth Street and bore a rigid, revealed
woman in emerald velvet, like a figure of pride
in a luminous shell. Her machine moved with
his up the slope. Mark examined her happily.
She chewed gum with the least movement of her
white and vermilion cheeks. He despised her
and felt strong against the pyramidal society in
which Walling, of Carlson and Walling, was disdained.
A cocktail in the Manhattan bar helped.
The yellow place was full of undergraduates bustling
away from Harvard and Yale. The consciousness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
of dull trim boots and the black, perpetual
decency of his dress raised Mark high out
of this herd. At least he knew better than to
smoke cigarettes with gold tips and the oblique,
racy colours of neckties had no meaning for him
beyond gaudiness. He strolled to the clapboards
and icy labyrinthine bewilderment of the station,
found the right gate and beheld uncountable
ladies gathered together with children in leather
gaiters, chauffeurs at attention smoking furtively.
Here, he knew, was good breeding collected to
take charge of its sons. The cocktail struggled
for a moment with cold air. Mark retired to the
rough wooden wall and watched this crowd. The
mingling voices never reached plangency. The
small girls and boys stirred like low flowers in
a field of dark, human stalks. Colours, this
winter, were sombre. The women walked with
restraint, with tiny gestures that revealed nothing,
with smiles to each other that meant nothing.
He had a feeling of deft performance and a
young fellow at the wall beside Mark chuckled,
lighting a cigarette.</p>

<p>&#8220;A lot of rich dames waitin&#8217; for their kids
from some goddam school up in Boston, see?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mark nodded. The young fellow gave the
grouped women another stare and crossed the
tight knees of his sailor&#8217;s breeches. The nostrils
of his shapely, short nose shook a trifle. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
tilted his flat cap further over an ear and winked
comradely at Mark, &#8220;Wonder who the kids&#8217;
fathers are, huh? A lot of rich dames....&#8221;
He spat and added, &#8220;Well, you can&#8217;t blame &#8217;em so
much. Their husban&#8217;s are all keepin&#8217; these chorus
girls. But it&#8217;s too much money, that&#8217;s what.
If they&#8217;d got to work some and cook an&#8217; all they
wouldn&#8217;t have time for this society stuff. It&#8217;s too
much money. If they&#8217;d got to cook their meals
they wouldn&#8217;t have time for carryin&#8217; on with
all these artists an&#8217; actors an&#8217; things&mdash;&#8221; He
broke off to snap at a girl who came hurrying
from a telephone booth, &#8220;Say, what in hell?
Makin&#8217; another date?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Honest, I was just phonin&#8217; mamma,&#8221; the girl
said.</p>

<p>&#8220;You took a time!&mdash;Phonin&#8217; her what?&#8221; He
scowled, dominating the girl, &#8220;Huh?&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl argued, &#8220;I&#8217;d got to tell her sump&#8217;n,
ain&#8217;t I, Jimmy? I told her I was goin&#8217; to a show
with a gerl fren&#8217;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Some friend,&#8221; said the sailor, laughed at
himself and tramped off with his girl under an
arm. The girl&#8217;s cheap suit of beryl cloth shook
out a scent of cinnamon. Mark sighed; she was
young and pretty and shouldn&#8217;t lie to her mother
about men. But perhaps her mother was bad
tempered, illiberal. Perhaps the flat was crowded
with a preposterous family and exuded this slim<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
thing often, hoping a fragment of pleasure. A
man couldn&#8217;t be critical. Mark went to meet
Gurdy and immediately forgot all discomforts
in seeing that the boy had grown an inch, that the
lashes about his dark blue eyes were blackening,
in hearing him admit that he was glad to be at
home again.</p>

<p>Gurdy&#8217;s schoolmates had sisters at Miss
Thorne&#8217;s, it seemed, and Mark waited, fretting,
through the Christmas holidays until his broker
wrote that Miss Thorne would be pleased to have
Margot as a pupil. Miss Converse, the governess,
asked Mark bluntly how he had managed
this matter.</p>

<p>&#8220;You Americans are extraordinary,&#8221; she said,
&#8220;You&#8217;re so&mdash;so essentially undemocratic. It&#8217;s
shocking. But we must get Margot some decent
frocks directly.&#8221;</p>

<p>The bill for Margot&#8217;s massed Christmas clothes
lay on his desk. Mark started, protesting,
&#8220;But&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been meaning to talk of this for some
time,&#8221; said the governess.</p>

<p>&#8220;Her clothes?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Her clothes.&mdash;My people were quite rich,
you know, and I had things from Paris but really&mdash;O,
really, Mr. Walling, you mustn&#8217;t let her
have every pretty frock she sees! I must say
you&#8217;ve more taste than most women&mdash;quite remarkable.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
But what will there be left for the
child when she comes out?&#8221;</p>

<p>He wanted to answer that no frock devised
of man could make Miss Converse other than a
bulky, angular female but gave his meek consent
to authority. He resented the dull serges and
linens of Margot&#8217;s school dress and Sunday became
precious because he saw her in all glory,
flounced in rose and sapphire. She was a miracle;
she deserved brilliancies of toned silk to set off
the pale brown of her skin, the crisp thickness
of her hair. But in June on the <i>Cedric</i> he
heard one woman say to another, &#8220;Positively indecent.
Like a doll,&#8221; when he walked the decks
with Margot and the other woman&#8217;s, &#8220;But she&#8217;s
quite lovely,&#8221; didn&#8217;t assuage that tart summary of
Margot&#8217;s costume. An elderly actress told him,
&#8220;My dear boy, you mustn&#8217;t overdo the child&#8217;s
clothes,&#8221; and a fat lady from Detroit came gurgling
to ask where he bought things for Margot.
He knew this creature to be the wife of a motor
king and looked down at her thoughtfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose you have daughters, yourself?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, three. All of them married. But they
still come to me for advice.&mdash;Mastin&#8217;s? I
thought so. Thank you so much.&#8221;</p>

<p>He watched her purple linen frock ruck up
in lumps as her fat knees bent over the brass
sill of a door and pitied her daughters. He was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
playing poker in the smoke room when Gurdy
slid into the couch beside him and sat silently
observing the game. The boy was lately thirteen
and gaunt. His silence coated an emotion that
Mark felt, disturbing as the chill of an audience
on an opening night. Gurdy was angry. The
milky skin below his lips twitched and wrinkled.
The luncheon bugle blew. The game stopped
and, when the other players rose, Mark could
turn to him. &#8220;Was that fat woman in tortoise
shell glasses talkin&#8217; to you?&#8221; The boy demanded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, it was a bet. I was reading in the
parlour place. It was a bet. One of the women
bet you got Margot&#8217;s things in New York and
the rest of &#8217;em said Paris. And that fat hog&mdash;&#8221;
Gurdy&#8217;s voice broke&mdash;&#8220;said she didn&#8217;t mind
slumming. So she went off and talked to you.
They all s-said that Margot looked like a
poster.&#8221;</p>

<p>This was horrible. Mark saw some likeness
between Margot&#8217;s pink splendour and the new
posters clever people made for him. He must be
wrong. He uncertainly fingered the pile of poker
chips and asked Gurdy, &#8220;D&#8217;you think sister&#8217;s&mdash;too
dressed up?&#8221;</p>

<p>Gurdy loosed a sob that slapped Mark&#8217;s face
with its misery and dashed his hand into the piled
chips. He said, &#8220;D-don&#8217;t give a dam&#8217; what they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
say about her. I hate hearin&#8217; them talk about
you that way!&#8221;</p>

<p>Mark waited until the nervous sobs slacked.
Then he asked, &#8220;Do they ever talk about me at
your school, sonny?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. Oh, one of the masters asked me why
you didn&#8217;t put on some play. Is there a play
called the Cherry Orchard?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Russian. It wouldn&#8217;t run a week.&#8221; Mark
piled up the chips and said, &#8220;I may be all wrong&mdash;Anyhow,
don&#8217;t you bother, son ... God bless
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Olive Ilden gave him her view while Margot
and Gurdy explored the garden that opened from
her Chelsea drawing room. She sat painting her
lips with a perfumed stick of deep red and mimicked
his drawl, &#8220;No, her things ar-r-ren&#8217;t too
bright, old man. She isn&#8217;t too much dressed up.
It&#8217;s merely that this thin faced time of ours isn&#8217;t
dressed up to her. She&#8217;s Della Robbia and we&#8217;re&mdash;Whistler.
It&#8217;s burgherdom. Prudence. It&#8217;s
the nineteenth century. It&#8217;s the tupenny ha&#8217;penny
belief that dullness is respectable. Hasn&#8217;t
she some Italian blood? Now Joan&mdash;my
wretched daughter&mdash;simply revels in dowdiness.
She&#8217;s only happy in a jersey or Girl Guides rubbish.
She&#8217;s at Cheltenham, mixing with the British
flapper. When she&#8217;s at home she drives me
into painting my face and putting dyed attire on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
my head. If I had to live with Margot I
shouldn&#8217;t wear anything gayer than taupe.&#8221;</p>

<p>He stared out at Margot whose pink frock revolved
above her gleaming silver buckles on the
crushed shell of the walk. Olive saw his face
light, attaining for the second a holy glow. It
was a window in the wall of dark night. He
looked and doted. The woman wondered at him.
He had all the breathless beauty of a child facing
its dearest toy. His grey eyes dilated. In her
own eyes she felt the dry threat of tears and
said, &#8220;Old man, I&#8217;m sorry for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because you&#8217;re such a dear and because you&#8217;re
a pariah. I don&#8217;t know that all this garden party
petting is good for our player folk but&mdash;over in
your wilderness&mdash;no one seems to investigate the
stage except professors and the police. It must
be sickening.... What&#8217;ll become of Margot
when she&#8217;s grown up?&#8221;</p>

<p>It had begun to worry him on the <i>Cedric</i>. He
loosely thought that her friends from Miss
Thorne&#8217;s school would be kind to her. Wouldn&#8217;t
they? He said, &#8220;She&#8217;s only ten, Olive,&#8221; and
sat brooding. It wasn&#8217;t fair. Smart society, the
decorous women of small gestures, hadn&#8217;t any
use for him. He looked at Olive who wrote
letters to him and called him old man. She wrote
books. She knew all the world. She had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
to the king&#8217;s court and laughed about it. He
went to shelter in her strange kindness and sighed,
&#8220;It isn&#8217;t fair. She ought to have&mdash;she ought to
go anywhere she wants to.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She probably will if there&#8217;s anything in eyelashes,&#8221;
said Olive, &#8220;and Gurdy will go anywhere
he wants to, by the shape of his jaw. I&#8217;ve been
dissecting American society with horrific interest.
It seems to have reached a lower level than British!
You haven&#8217;t even an intelligent Bohemia.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There ain&#8217;t many literary people,&#8221; Mark reflected,
&#8220;and they mostly seem to live in Philadelphia
and Indiana, anyhow. Or over here.
What&#8217;s a man to do? I can&#8217;t&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t do anything. Whistle the children
in. There&#8217;s a one man show. Stage settings.
Italian. I haven&#8217;t seen them and you should.&#8221;
She threw the stick of paint away and set about
cheering him. She liked him, muddled in his
trade, labouring after beauty, unaware of his own
odd sweetness. She gave up the last weeks of the
season, guiding him about London, watching him
glow when Margot wanted a scarf of orange silk
in Liberty&#8217;s, when Gurdy demonstrated his Latin,
not badly, before a tomb in Saint Paul&#8217;s. Margot
was the obvious idol, something to be petted
and dressed. But the child had a rich attraction
of her own, graces of placid curves, a quiet loveliness
that missed stupidity.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>&#8220;You don&#8217;t like Margot,&#8221; Olive told Gurdy in
a waste of the British Museum.</p>

<p>The boy lied, &#8220;Of course I do,&#8221; in his cracked
voice but Olive took that as the product of good
schooling, like his easy performance of airs on
the piano. He was jealous of Margot and
showed it so often that the woman wondered
why Mark didn&#8217;t see. But this wasn&#8217;t the usual
boy.</p>

<p>&#8220;You let him read anything he likes,&#8221; she
scolded Mark.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure. Where&#8217;s the harm? I haven&#8217;t got the
Contes Drolatiques at the house or any of those
things. Aunt Edith used to make me read the
Book of Kings when I was a kid. Oh, Gurd
knows that babies don&#8217;t come by express,&#8221; said
Mark, &#8220;He&#8217;s lived in the country, too much.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought the American peasantry entirely
compounded of the Puritan virtues, old man.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You missed your guess, then. You read a lot
of American novels, Olive. Some day or other
some writer&#8217;s goin&#8217; to come along and write up
an American country town like it is. The police
will probably suppress the book.... My father
and Gurdy&#8217;s mamma are sort of scared because
I&#8217;ve got the kid at a rich school. You mustn&#8217;t
believe all the stuff you see in the American magazines
and papers about the wicked rich, Olive.
I&#8217;ve met some of the rich roués at suppers and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
so on. Put any of &#8217;em alongside some of the
hired men and clerks and things that were in my
regiment in Cuba&mdash;or alongside Tommy Grover
that&#8217;s blacksmith at Fayettesville and they&#8217;d look
like Sunday School teachers. I sort of wish the
poor folks in the United States&#8217;d leave off yawping
about the wicked rich and look after their
own backyards a while! No, I don&#8217;t take any
stock in this country virtue thing. The only girl
in Fayettesville that ever run off with a wicked
drummer had morals that&#8217;d scare a chorus girl
stiff. Who&#8217;s the fellow that hangs &#8217;round the
stage door of a musical show? Nine times out
of ten he&#8217;s a kid from the country that&#8217;s won
twenty dollars at poker. Who&#8217;s the fellow that&mdash;well&mdash;seduces
the poor working girl? Once
in a hundred it&#8217;s a rich whelp in a dinner jacket.
Rest of the time it&#8217;s the boy in the next flat.
When I was acting and used to get mash notes
from fool women, were they from women on
Fifth Avenue or Park Avenue? Not much!
Stenographers and ladies in Harlem that had
husbands travelling a good deal. You believe in
talking about these kind of things out loud and I
expect you&#8217;re right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Gurdy&#8217;s not handsome,&#8221; said Olive, &#8220;but he&#8217;s
attractive&mdash;charming eyes&mdash;and women are going
to like him a goodish bit, bye and bye. And man
is fire. What moral precepts are you going to&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>&#8220;Just what my father told me. I&#8217;m going to
tell him that he mustn&#8217;t make love to a married
woman and that he mustn&#8217;t fool after an innocent
girl unless he means matrimony&mdash;but God knows
it&#8217;s getting pretty hard to tell what an innocent
girl is, these days! Nine tenths of &#8217;em dress like
cocottes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Old man, where did you pick up that very decent
French accent?&#8221; Olive saw his blush slide
fleetly from his collar to the red hair and added,
&#8220;I hope it was honestly come by. You&#8217;re a good
deal of a Puritan for a sensualist.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh ... I am a sensualist, I guess. But, I
ain&#8217;t a hog.&#8221;</p>

<p>Olive said, &#8220;No, that&#8217;s quite true, my son.
There&#8217;s nothing porcine about you. My brother
has a house this season and he&#8217;s giving a dance
tonight. There might be some pretty frocks.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t know you had a brother!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sir Gerald Shelmardine of Shelmardine Cross,
Hampshire. He&#8217;s rather dreary. Will you
come?&#8221;</p>

<p>She took him to several evening parties and
his wooden coldness before a crowd was enchanting.
It occurred to her that individuals wearied
the man. He eyed pretty women, striking gowns,
studied the decoration of ball-rooms. He confessed,
&#8220;I&#8217;ll never see any of them again and
shouldn&#8217;t remember them if I did. My memory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
for people&#8217;s no good&mdash;unless they&#8217;re interestin&#8217;
to look at. My god, look at that girl in purple.
Her dressmaker ought to be hung! Skirt&#8217;s
crooked all across the front.&#8221; He gave the girl
in purple his rare frown then asked, &#8220;Well,
where&#8217;s some place in France, on the seashore,
where I can take the kids until August?&#8221;</p>

<p>She recommended Royan and had from him a
letter describing Margot&#8217;s success among the
ladies of a quiet hotel. His letters of 1912 and
1913 were full of Margot. Snapshots of the
child dropped often from the thick blue envelopes.
When he sent his thin book, &#8220;Modern Scenery&#8221;
in the autumn of 1913 it was dedicated, &#8220;To my
Daughter.&#8221; The bald prose was correct, the
photographs and plates were well selected. Mark
wrote: &#8220;Gurdy went over it with a fine tooth
comb to see if the grammar was O. K. Mr.
Carlson is not well and we have four plays to
bring in by December. Spoke at a lunch of a
ladies&#8217; dramatic society yesterday. Forgot where
I was and said Hell in the middle of it. They
did not mind. Things seem to be changing a lot.
I am pretty worried about one of our plays.&#8221;</p>

<p>Olive saw in the New York <i>Herald</i> some discussion
of this play and a furious reference to it
on the editorial page, signed by a clergyman.
This was at Christmas time when she was entertaining
her tiresome brother at Ilden&#8217;s house in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
Suffolk. She folded the newspaper away, meaning
to explore the business. She forgot the accident
in the hurry of her attempt to reach a
Scotch country house where her daughter Joan
died of pneumonia on New Year&#8217;s Day. The
shock sent Olive into grey seclusion. Her husband
was on the China station with his cruiser.
She suddenly found herself worrying over the
health of her son, then in the Fifth Form at Harrow,
so took a cottage in Harrow village and
there reflected on the nastiness of death while
she wrote her next novel. The cottage was singularly
dismal and the daughters of the next dwelling
were pretty girls of thirteen and fourteen,
with fair hair. &#8220;Sentimental analogy is the bane
of life,&#8221; she wrote to her husband, &#8220;I went to
town yesterday for some gloves and saw the posters
of Peter Pan on a hoarding in Baker Street.
Joan liked it so. So I went to the theatre and
squandered five sovereigns in stalls and gave the
tickets to these wretched girls who would infinitely
prefer a cinema, naturally. However I managed
to laugh on Saturday. The news had just reached
Mark Walling by way of Ian Gail who is in the
States trying to sell his worst and newest play.
Mark cabled me a hundred words quite incoherent
and mostly inappropriate.&#8221;</p>

<p>Three days later Olive came in from a walk
and Mark opened the door of the stupid cottage.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
When she drew her hands away from his stooped
face they were hot and wet.</p>

<p>&#8220;But, my dear boy,&#8221; she said, presently, &#8220;what
blessing brought you over? In the middle of
your season, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m in trouble. See anything in the papers
about the Mayor stoppin&#8217; a play we put on?&mdash;I
don&#8217;t blame the Mayor, for a minute. Mr. Carlson
wanted it.... Well, it was stopped and
some of the newspapers took it up. And then
Mr. Carlson had a sort of stroke. His mind&#8217;s
all right but his legs are paralyzed. Won&#8217;t ever
walk again.&#8221; His voice drummed suddenly as
if it might break into a sob. He passed his
fingers over the red hair and went on, &#8220;I&#8217;ve got
him up at my house.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; said Olive.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure. The doctors say he&#8217;ll last four or five
years, maybe.&mdash;Say you&#8217;ve always said we&#8217;re a nation
of prudes. Look at this,&#8221; and he dragged
from a black pocket a note on formal paper.
Olive read: &#8220;The Thorne School, Madison
Avenue and Sixty Sixth Street. December 28th,
1913. My dear Mr. Walling, Will you be so
good as to call upon me when it is possible in order
to discuss Margaret&#8217;s future attendance. It
seems kindest to warn you that several parents
have suggested that&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>&#8220;What is this nonsense?&#8221; Olive asked, &#8220;What&#8217;s
the child been doing?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Doing? Nothin&#8217;! It&#8217;s this damned play!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean that there were women who seriously
asked this Miss Thorne to have Margot
withdrawn because you&#8217;d produced a risqué farce?
But that&#8217;s&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>His wrath reached a piteous climax in, &#8220;Oh,
damn women, anyhow!... Well I took her
out. My broker could have fixed the thing up.
What&#8217;s the use? Well, I brought her over with
me. She&#8217;s at the Ritz. What&#8217;s the best girls&#8217;
school in England?&#8221;</p>

<p>Olive said, &#8220;Oh, I&#8217;ll take her,&#8221; saw him smile
and began to weep.</p>

Margot</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">GURDY BERNAMER kept his twentieth
birthday in a trench. The next
week his regiment was withdrawn from
the line to a dull village where Gurdy was taking
a warm bath in a zinc tub behind the Mairie when
a German aeroplane crossed above and lifted his
attention from a Red Cross copy of &#8220;The Brook
Kerith&#8221; which he read while he soaked. He
dropped the dialectics of George Moore and
watched, then saw the whitewashed wall of the
yard bend in slowly, its cracks blackening. He
spent a month in hospital getting the best of the
wandering, deep wound that began at his right
hip and ended in his armpit. He wrote to Mark,
&#8220;I kept trying to remember a quotation from
Twain&#8217;s Tramp Abroad. &#8216;Not by war&#8217;s shock or
war&#8217;s shaft. Shot with a rock on a raft.&#8217; They
dug a piece of zinc out of me. I feel fairly
well. Mrs. Tilford Arbuthnot has the Y. M. C.
A. cafeteria in Bordeaux. Her brother was with
me at Saint Andrew&#8217;s. She brings me novels and
things. I think she has a secret passion for you.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
She says you were a great actor. My nurse also
thinks you were. Her name is Zippah Coe and
she looks it. She says the immorality of French
women is too awful for words. She is coming
to take my temperature.&#8221; The temperature displeased
the nurse and Gurdy passed into a daze.
The wet hemlocks beyond the window sometimes
turned cerise, inexcusably. Pneumonia succeeded
his influenza.</p>

<p>Through all this lapse he meditated and drew
toward a belief that life was a series of meaningless
illusions, many painful. He expanded &#8220;All
the world&#8217;s a stage.&#8221; Suicide wasn&#8217;t universal
as some of the players acquired a thrilling interest
in their parts, rose to be directors&mdash;Wilsons,
Northcliffes, Millerands. It was satisfactory to
know this at twenty. His education was complete
in its departments passional, athletic and philosophical.
Saint Andrew&#8217;s school. Two and a
half years of Yale in smart company. The miscellany
of his regiment. He must certainly begin
maturity as a critic. He lay composing an essay
on the illusory value of passion in a loop of paradoxes
which vanished as his pulse improved.
Then he was conscious that a surgeon took interest
in him. Orderlies came from the hospital
adjutant inquiring. Gurdy sat up, read the
papers and accepted five thousand francs in mauve
and blue bills from a bank agent. It seemed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
that Mark had run him to earth by cabling. Soon
he was uniformed again and given orders that
assigned him to duty in a Paris military bureau.
There Gurdy found Mark&#8217;s broker, decorated
as a Major.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course, I got you up here,&#8221; said Major
Villay. &#8220;Why not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But&mdash;&#8221; With recovery Gurdy had shed some
sense of illusions. He stood thinking of his regiment
rather sourly, rather sadly.</p>

<p>The broker-major grunted, &#8220;Rot, Gurdy.
You&#8217;re all Mark&#8217;s got&mdash;Son, and all that. Dare
say Margot&#8217;ll marry some Englishman. Anyhow,
it&#8217;s all over. Bulgaria&#8217;s on the skids.
Mark thinks too much of you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gurdy was subtly pleased. He stood thinking
of Mark fondly, with annotations in contempt.
Mark was nothing but a big blunderer among
the arts, a man who couldn&#8217;t see the strength of
Russian drama or disillusioned comedy, who
didn&#8217;t admire Granville Barker&#8217;s plays. But if
Margot stayed in England Gurdy could steer his
uncle toward proper productions. Mark meant
well, very well. He had done some fine things,
had a feeling for vesture, anyhow.</p>

<p>&#8220;I see the Celebrities people have bought the
Terriss Pictograph,&#8221; said Major Villay, &#8220;Exchange
of stock. Funny. Mark hates the
movies so and he makes twenty thousand a year<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
out of them. And the movie people gave him
fifteen thousand for that rotten Gail play. Here,
take this stuff and translate it. I can probably
get you a pass over to London if you want to see
Margot.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gurdy didn&#8217;t want to see her. His last view
of Margot had been in the stress of her removal
from Miss Thorne&#8217;s school. Mark had gone
five times to England on visits of a month, reported
her beautiful, witty, petted by Mrs. Ilden,
by Mrs. Ilden&#8217;s friends. But he wrote her a
note dutifully and got an answer in three lines.
&#8220;Glad you are out of the silly mess. Try to run
over. Frightfully rushed catching a train for
Devon. More later.&#8221; He was not offended.
He thought that Margot disliked him as he disliked
her. He threw the note into the waste
basket and went on translating French political
comments into English.</p>

<p>The Armistice broke on the third week of
this employment. The bureau became a negation
of labour. Gurdy roamed contentedly about the
feverish, foolish city with various friends&mdash;young
officers, sergeant majors on agreeable posts. He
was tall, still pallid from sunless convalescence.
His uniform happened to fit a long, loosely moving
body and he liked dancing. He equably observed
male diversion with his dark blue eyes
and was often diverted. This might be the collapse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
of known society, the beginning of a hygienic
and hardworked future. This churning of
illusions might bring something fresh. Men
might turn to new programs of stupidity, exhausting
the old. He danced and was courted.
He wrote to Mark, choosing words: &#8220;There
will be plays about this, I suppose. I do not
think any one will believe it fifty years from now.
It is an upheaval of cheap pleasure. I keep
thinking how Carlson calls people hogs.&#8221; He
hesitated, continued: &#8220;I do not know that there
is an excuse for all of it. Some of the Americans
make bigger hogs of themselves than is necessary.&#8221;
Then he destroyed the letter. After
all, Mark was your typical patriot. He took
America seriously, the American soldier seriously,
the American Red Cross had profited by his sentiment.
There was no point in hurting Mark.
Gurdy wrote a gay tale of driving through Paris
in a vegetable cart with a drunken Australian
colonel and went to dine at Luca&#8217;s.</p>

<p>From Luca&#8217;s his party retired to the Opera
Comique, stopped to drink champagne in the bar
and stayed there until it wasn&#8217;t worth while to
hear the last act. &#8220;And,&#8221; said a youth from San
Francisco, &#8220;we can go to Ariana Joyce&#8217;s. She&#8217;s
giving a party.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But she&#8217;s dead,&#8221; Gurdy objected.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>&#8220;Damn healthy corpse! Come ahead and see
if she&#8217;s dead!&#8221;</p>

<p>They floated in a taxicab along Paris. The
machine slipped from the lavender rush of some
broad street up a slope and Gurdy stumbled into
a brilliance of laughing people where his guide
pushed him toward a green dais and hissed, &#8220;She
won&#8217;t know you from Adam. Tell her you&#8217;re
from Chicago.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her rounded beauty had come to death under
much fat. She lolled in a red chair waving a
peacock fan. Gurdy&#8217;s friend kissed the arm she
thrust out and told her, &#8220;You look awfully well,
Miss Joyce.&#8221;</p>

<p>The dancer nodded, beaming down at her
painted feet in their sandals of blue leather.
Through her nose she said, &#8220;Feelin&#8217; fine,&#8221; then
in throaty refinement, &#8220;Do get Choute Aurec to
dance. She&#8217;s so difficult now she&#8217;s had a success.
So very difficult&mdash;Rodin used to say&mdash;&#8221; Her
empty and tired stare centred on Gurdy. With
a vague dignity she asked, &#8220;Do I know you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Corporal Bernamer&#8217;s from Chicago,&#8221; the
guide said.</p>

<p>Miss Joyce planted a thumb under her chin
and drawled, &#8220;De mon pays!&#8221; then her eyes
rolled away. She reached for a silver cup on a
table and forgot her guests. Looking back,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
Gurdy saw her famous head thrown back and, for
a moment, comely as she drank.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bakst,&#8221; said his friend, jerking a hand about
to show the walls of grey paint where strange
beasts cavorted among spiked trees, above the
mixed and coloured motion of the crowd. An
American was playing ragtime at the gold piano,
in a clot of women. Choute Aurec was teaching
a British aviator some new dance. Beyond, a
mass of women and officers surrounded a lean
shape on a divan. They gazed, gaped, craned at
the young man. His decorations twinkled in the
glow. His blue chest stirred when he spoke and
his teeth flashed. Gurdy&#8217;s companion murmured,
&#8220;They say he&#8217;s got ten times more sense than
most prize-fighters.... I think that thin man&#8217;s
Bernstein&mdash;the one with a dinner jacket. You get
drinks in the next room. Oh, there&#8217;s Alixe!&#8221;</p>

<p>He ran off. Gurdy slid through the mingling
harlots and warriors into the next, cooler room,
fringed with men drinking champagne. An
American colonel glared at him over a glass,
shifted the glare back to a handsome ensign who
had penned a blond girl in a corner. Gurdy
found a tray covered with sandwiches and ate one,
pondering. He wondered whether the ensign
would go on trying to kiss the girl if he knew that
she had been, last month, on trial for the technical
murder of an octogenarian general. Well,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
morals were illusory, too. Some one slapped his
shoulder. He saw Ian Gail. The playwright
was dressed as a British captain. &#8220;Intelligence,&#8221;
he said, &#8220;I&#8217;m too old and adipose for anything
else. And we shouldn&#8217;t be here, should we? A
poisonous place.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Funny mixture.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pride,&#8221; said Gail, &#8220;The poor woman can&#8217;t
stand being neglected so she gives these atrocious
parties. But it&#8217;s nice running into you, old son.
I&#8217;d a letter from Mark yesterday. He told me
you were here and I was coming to look you up
tomorrow in any case. I&#8217;m just from London.
Olive Ilden and Margot are hoping you&#8217;ll get
leave to come over for Christmas. Can&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t quite see how I can, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But do try. I think you&#8217;d cheer Olive up.
Margot&#8217;s a jolly little thing but frightfully busy
celebrating the peace. How decent of Mark to
let her stay with Olive! I fancied he&#8217;d take her
back to the States directly the war began.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Submarines,&#8221; Gurdy said, &#8220;But why does Mrs.
Ilden need cheering up, sir? She used to be an
awfully cheerful sort of person.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; said Gail, &#8220;her boy&mdash;Bobby.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hadn&#8217;t heard he&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fell a year ago. Do try to run over....
How pretty Margot is!&#8221;</p>

<p>Gurdy ate another sandwich, correcting champagne.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
There would be long illusions after this
war. Grudges, idealized memories of trivial
folk. But he was sorry for Olive Ilden. He
said, &#8220;I&#8217;ll try to get over. I&#8217;ll&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Choute Aurec ran through the doorway, yelped,
&#8220;Ariane va danser, messieurs, dames!&#8221; and
darted out again.</p>

<p>&#8220;What did that incontinent little brute say?&#8221;
Gail asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think Miss Joyce is going to dance,&#8221; said
Gurdy.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s disgusting,&#8221; the Englishman snorted,
&#8220;Some cad always flatters her into dancing and the
poor woman falls on her face. Don&#8217;t go.&#8221;</p>

<p>The doorway filled with watchers. Women
giggled. Some one played slowly the first bars of
the Volga Barge song. There was an applausive
murmur&mdash;then a thud. &#8220;She&#8217;s fallen,&#8221; said Gail
and suddenly Gurdy remembered that this was an
American, that he had seen her dance to the
jammed ecstasy of the Metropolitan. The
women in the doorway squealed their amusement.
The crowd parted and he saw the green gauze
wrapping her limp body as two Frenchmen
carried her back to her throne. The crowd
applauded, now.</p>

<p>&#8220;Swine,&#8221; said Gail.</p>

<p>Gurdy summoned up his philosophy and
shrugged. The young prize-fighter came through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
the press and snapped to a civilian, &#8220;Je me sauve,
Etienne!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mais&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;C&#8217;est nauséabonde! Elle était artiste, vois
tu? Allons; je file!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The boy&#8217;s right,&#8221; said the playwright, &#8220;Sickening.
Come along.&#8221; They passed through the
beginning of a dance in the great chamber and
down the stairs into an alley where motors were
lined. In a taxicab Gail concluded, &#8220;End of an
artist.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gurdy thought this sententious but a queer
oppression filled him. It was hideous that any
one should finish as a butt with a prize-fighter for
apologist. Of course, life was nothing but a
meaningless spectacle. Money, something to
drink, a dancing floor drew this crowd together.
The fat dancer was rather funny, if one looked it
all over. Mark could contrive the whole effect on
a stage if he wanted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mark writes that he&#8217;s almost decided to build
his theatre in West Forty Seventh.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish he&#8217;d hurry,&#8221; said Gurdy, &#8220;He&#8217;s been
planning the Walling for years. Funny. He
told Mr. Frohman all about it just before the
<i>Lusitania</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Poor Frohman,&#8221; the Englishman murmured,
&#8220;Awfully decent to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>There should be a certain decency, a cool<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
restraint in life, the philosopher mused. He
thought of this next morning when Choute Aurec
telephoned hopefully for a loan of a thousand
francs. By noon he had discovered that he was
flatly homesick for Mark and thought of Margot
in London as the nearest familiar creature. The
bureau permitted his departure. He crossed a
still Channel and made his way to London in
the company of an earnest Red Cross girl from
Omaha who wanted Fontainebleau turned into
a reform school for rescued Parisian street walkers.
She had a General for uncle and Gurdy
feared that she would be able to forward her plan
to the French government.</p>

<p>&#8220;D&#8217;you really feel that we&#8217;ve any business telling
the French what to do with their own homes?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But Fontainebleau could be made into a real
home, Corpril!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So could Mount Vernon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s too small. Fontainebleau&#8217;s so huge.
All those rooms.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t think that it&#8217;s any use just letting
it stay beautiful?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But it isn&#8217;t really beautiful,&#8221; the young woman
retorted, &#8220;It&#8217;s so much of it Renaissance, you
know?&#8221;</p>

<p>He was still hating this vacuity when the taxicab
left him at Mrs. Ilden&#8217;s house in Chelsea.
The butler told him that &#8220;Lady Ilden&#8221; was not at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
home and guided him through grey halls to a
bedroom. Gurdy washed, tried to recall Ilden&#8217;s
rank in the British navy and the name of
Olive&#8217;s last novel. He strolled downstairs and
met Margot in the lower hall without knowing
it. He saw a slim person in stark yellow reading
a letter and was startled when the girl said,
&#8220;Good God, they didn&#8217;t tell me you&#8217;d got here!
Come and help me stick this holly about in the
library.&#8221;</p>

<p>She thrust a bowl filled with small sprays of
holly into his hands and frowned between the
wings of her black, bobbed hair. He remembered
her plump. She was slender. She still
wore glittering pumps with silver buckles. When
she chuckled it was in the former chime. She exclaimed,
&#8220;Of course! Uncle Eddie was born in
Norway, wasn&#8217;t he?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think dad was born in the steerage, coming
over,&#8221; Gurdy said.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re not at all American, anyhow,&#8221; she
announced, &#8220;and that&#8217;s a relief. I&#8217;m quite mad
about Scandinavians. Only sensible people in
Europe. Come along. There&#8217;s a rehearsal in
half a minute and&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Rehearsal?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Charity show. Barge along. This way.&#8221;</p>

<p>He grinned and followed her into the long
library where she tossed bits of holly to and fro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
on the shelves. She said, &#8220;Cosmo Rand&#8217;s rehearsing
us. Better not tell that to dad. He
mightn&#8217;t like it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s Cosmo?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Cora Boyle&#8217;s husband. They&#8217;re playing here.
Don&#8217;t get shocked about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t see anything to get shocked about. So
Cora Boyle&#8217;s over here again? What&#8217;s she playing?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A silly melodrama. She&#8217;s at the Diana. Saw
her the other night. She&#8217;s getting fat. Ought
to be a law against fat women wearing old rose.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve lost some weight,&#8221; Gurdy said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Work, old thing, work! Sewing shirts
for snipers. Dancing with convalescents.&mdash;It&#8217;s
beastly you&#8217;ve got so tall. I hate looking up at
men.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gurdy laughed down at her and asked, &#8220;When
did Mrs. Ilden get to be Lady Ilden?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Jutland. It&#8217;s just the Bath, not a baronetcy.
Olive&#8217;s at church.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought she was agnostic?&#8221;</p>

<p>Margot said gently, &#8220;It takes them that way,
rather often. She&#8217;s been to church a goodish bit
ever since Bobby&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes. Young Ilden was killed.&mdash;What
sort of person was he?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;One of the silent, strong Empire builders&mdash;but
nice about it.... Olive&#8217;s aged, rather.&#8221; She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
planted the last holly spray on the lap of a gilt
Buddha then smiled at Gurdy across a yellow
shoulder, &#8220;I&#8217;d forgotten how blue your eyes are.
Almost violet. Goes with your hair. Very effective....
Your chin&#8217;s still too big.... Oh,
a letter from Dad this morning. He was thinking
of running over. But Carlson&#8217;s worse....
D&#8217;you know, it&#8217;d be a noble deed to poison Carlson.
There he is stuck in the house. Why
don&#8217;t useless people like that dry up and blow
away?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think he&#8217;s useless,&#8221; Gurdy argued,
&#8220;He makes Mark put on a comedy now and then.
He swears better than any one I know. And
you ought to be grateful to him. If Mark
hadn&#8217;t had him for company you&#8217;d probably have
been hauled home long ago.&#8221;</p>

<p>Margot opened a Russian, lead box on a table
and lit a cigarette. She said, &#8220;Don&#8217;t think so.
Dad&#8217;s never made the slightest sign of hauling
me home. Especially after Mr. Frohman....
Ugh! I almost had nervous prostration, when
I heard Dad had sailed after the <i>Lusitania</i>!&#8221;
Her lids fell and shook the astonishing lashes
against the pale brown of her cheeks. Then
she chuckled, &#8220;The joke is, I&#8217;d as soon have gone
home long ago. I&#8217;m mad about Olive, of course.
And I&#8217;ve had all sorts of a good time. But I&#8217;d
rather be home.... How&#8217;s your mother?&#8221;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
He was answering when the butler barked names
from the doorway. Margot whispered, &#8220;Run.
The rehearsal. Go hide in the drawing room.
These are all bores.&#8221;</p>

<p>He passed out through a group of men and
girls, encountered a Colonel of the British General
Staff in the hall and was cordially halted.
He stood discussing military shoes with this dignitary
as Olive Ilden let herself into the hall.
Gurdy recalled her slim and tall. Now that he
looked down, she seemed stout, no longer handsome
but the deep voice remained charming as
it rose from her black veils. She led him off into
the drawing room and said, at once, &#8220;Margot&#8217;s
pretty, isn&#8217;t she?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. Mark&#8217;s been raving about her but I
thought&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You thought he was idealizing, after his customary
manner? He sent me a picture of you,
so I&#8217;m not surprised. Don&#8217;t sit in that chair. It&#8217;s
for pygmies.... I want to talk about Margot
and it&#8217;s likely we won&#8217;t have another chance. You
two don&#8217;t write each other letters. Had you
heard from Mark that she wants to play?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Play?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Be an actress. I thought I&#8217;d better warn
you,&#8221; Olive laughed, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know when it
started. I know Mark wouldn&#8217;t like it. Otherwise
the child&#8217;s the delight of my life.&#8221; She sank<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
into a couch and asked, &#8220;Now, what are these diplomatic
idiots doing in Paris? I don&#8217;t like the
look of things.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Arranging for another war.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do hope they&#8217;ll arrange it for twenty years
from date. I&#8217;ll be past sixty then and I won&#8217;t
care. I&#8217;ll be able to sit and grin at the women
who&#8217;re going through what&mdash;Only, of course, I
shouldn&#8217;t grin. I&#8217;m a true blue Briton of the old
breed when it comes to an emotion. I simply
can&#8217;t enjoy an emotion when it&#8217;s my emotion....
Had you ever thought that that&#8217;s why bad plays
and cinema rubbish are so popular? It&#8217;s the unreality
of the passions.... I dare say that&#8217;s why
I&#8217;ve just been to church.... Perhaps that&#8217;s why
Margot wants to go on the stage. She&#8217;s never
had an emotion worth shedding a tear for. Well,
how&#8217;s Mark?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Putting on three plays after Christmas and
thinks they&#8217;re all winners.&#8221;</p>

<p>She drew her hands over her eyes and murmured,
&#8220;Mark&#8217;s extraordinary. Endless enthusiasm.
Like a kiddy with a box of water
colours. I suppose it&#8217;s belief. He really believes
in his job.... I once thought he needed education....
If he&#8217;d been educated, he couldn&#8217;t
have believed so hard.... There has to be something
childish to get along in the theatre....
If he were worldly wise he&#8217;d have known half<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
these plays were rubbish and the rest not very
good.... But I&#8217;m not sure what a good play
is, Gurdy. Tell me. You&#8217;re young, so you
should know.&#8221;</p>

<p>He flushed, then laughed and asked what play
Margot and her friends rehearsed. The loud,
spaced voices came across the hall. He felt an
unruly curiosity stir.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a one act thing of Ronny Dufford&#8217;s&mdash;Colonel
the Honourable Ronald Dufford. Quite a
pal of Margot&#8217;s. That was he talking to you
in the hall just now&mdash;the Brass Hat. What are
you laughing at?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wondering what would happen to an American
General Staff man if he wrote plays....
Dufford? Mark put a thing of his on in nineteen
sixteen. It failed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;His things are rather thin. He&#8217;s been nice
to Margot, though. He took her about when I
was in mourning&mdash;He&#8217;s a good sort. Forty
eight or so. I dare say he lectured Margot on
the greatness of Empire and the sacredness of the
House of Lords. It didn&#8217;t hurt her. She hears
enough about the sacredness of the plain people,
in the studios.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought you were an anti-imperialist and an
anarchist?&#8221;</p>

<p>The tired woman laughed, &#8220;So I am.... It
was tremendous fun being all the right things<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
when I was young and anarchists were rather few.
I expect you&#8217;re a cubist and a communist and agnostic
and don&#8217;t believe in marriage. So many of
them don&#8217;t. Then they get married to prove the
soundness of their theory and get hurt; then
they&#8217;re annoyed because they&#8217;re hurt and get interested
in being married. Most amusing to
watch.... The world&#8217;s got past me and I&#8217;m
frightened by it.&mdash;We had such a good time railing
at the Victorians and repression. And now
all the clever young things tell their emotions to
cab drivers and invent emotions if they haven&#8217;t
any.&mdash;All the gestures have changed and I feel&mdash;You
look rather like Mark. You know he was
stopping at Winchester when he heard Margot&#8217;s
father&#8217;d been killed. I tried to shock him.
He.... Oh, do go and watch them rehearse,
Gurdy!... I&#8217;ve just come from church....
The music&#8217;s made me silly. I don&#8217;t know what
I&#8217;m saying....&#8221; The artifice smashed into a
sob. Gurdy swung and hurried across the hall.
Certainly, the woman&#8217;s illusion of pain was
notably real.</p>

<p>He sat smoking on a window seat of the library
and tried to follow the rehearsal at the other end
of the wide room. The men and girls strode
about talking loudly. A slender man in grey
broke the chatter from time to time and gave
directions in a level, pleasing voice. This must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
be Cosmo Rand, the husband of Cora Boyle.
Gurdy looked at him with interested scorn but the
amateurs took his orders in docile peace and only
Margot answered him from a deep green chair,
&#8220;Rot, Cossy! I&#8217;m supposed to be lost in thought,
aren&#8217;t I? Then I shan&#8217;t look interested when
Stella giggles. Go on, Stella.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gurdy became intent on her posture in the dark
chair. She was smoking and her hair appeared
through the vapour like solid, carved substance.
She seemed fixed, a black and yellow figure on the
green. A vaporous halo rose in the lamplight
above her head. He stirred when she spoke
again, shifting, and a silver buckle sent a spark of
light flitting across the rug. He remembered
that she had Italian blood from her grandmother.
She looked Italian. Mark was right. She was
beautiful in no common fashion. The other girls
vibrating against the shelves were mere bodies,
gurgling voices.&mdash;The butler stole down the room
and spoke to Cosmo Rand who, in turn, spoke
aloud.</p>

<p>&#8220;I say, Margot, Cora&#8217;s brought the motor
around. Might I have her in? Chilly and she&#8217;s
been feeling rather seedy.&#8221;</p>

<p>A tall woman in black velvet entered as if this
were a stage and reposed herself in a chair.
Gurdy had never seen Cora Boyle perform. She
was familiar from pictures when she drew up a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
veil across an obvious beauty of profile and wide
eyes. Presently she commenced a cigarette and
the motion of lighting it was admirably effected.
An expanding, heavy scent of maltreated tobacco
welled from the burning roll between her fingers.
The line of her brows was prolonged downward
with paint. The whole mask was tinted to a
false and gleaming pallor. Grey furs were arranged
about the robustness of her upper body.
She was older than Mark, Gurdy&#8217;s father said.
She must be passing forty. She should be weary
of tight slippers. A glance stopped Gurdy&#8217;s
meditation. He looked away at Margot&#8217;s effortless
stroll along the imagined footlights. Cora
Boyle spoke to him in a flat and pinched whisper.</p>

<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t your name Bernamer?&#8221; He bowed.
She came to sit with him on the window seat and
dusted ash from her cigarette into the Chinese
bowl. Her eyes explored his face with a civil
amusement. &#8220;You look awfully like your father.
You startled me. Let me see.... You and
Miss Walling live with Mark, don&#8217;t you? Sweet,
isn&#8217;t she? And how is Mark? I&#8217;ve played over
here so long that I&#8217;ve rawther lost touch. Mr.
Carlson&#8217;s still alive?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes. He&#8217;s bedridden, you know? Lives
with Mark.&#8221;</p>

<p>She inhaled smoke, nodding.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s so characteristic of Mark, isn&#8217;t it?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
But of course, Carlson was kind to him. The
dear old man&#8217;s bark was much worse than his
bite. Good heavens how frightened I was of
him! I see that Mark acted in a couple of Red
Cross shows? I expect that all his old matinée
girls turned out and cried for joy.... But I do
think that Mark was something more than a
flapper&#8217;s dream of heaven. Still, he must like
management better. He never thought more of
acting than that it was a job, did he?&#8221; She
sighed, &#8220;One has to think more of it than that
to get on.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gurdy wished that this woman didn&#8217;t embarrass
him, resenting her perfumed cigarette and
the real, frail loveliness of her hands. The embarrassment
ended. Rand told the amateurs
that they weren&#8217;t half bad and departed with his
wife, a trim, boyish figure behind her velvet bulk.
Colonel Dufford implored the grouped players to
learn their lines. Margot was much kissed by
the other girls, dismissed them and came in a sort
of dance step to ask Gurdy what he thought of
her acting.</p>

<p>&#8220;Couldn&#8217;t hear you. I had to talk to Miss
Boyle. Ugly voice she has. Are people really
crazy about her here?&#8221;</p>

<p>Margot frowned and pursed her lips, tapping a
cigarette on a nail. &#8220;Oh, she has a following.
They don&#8217;t dither about her as they do over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
Elsie whatsername and some of the other Americans.
Dull, isn&#8217;t she?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very. She made a point of talking about
Mark.&mdash;Lady Ilden&#8217;s all broken up, isn&#8217;t she?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s too repressed,&#8221; Margot explained.
&#8220;Tried not to show it when Bobby fell and so
she&#8217;s been showing it ever since. And Sir John&#8217;s
been at sea constantly and that&#8217;s a strain. He&#8217;s
in Paris, now.&mdash;You don&#8217;t show your feelings at
all, do you? I was watching you talk to the
Boyle and you beamed very nicely. And you
must have been bored. One of those rather
sticky women. Come and play pool. There&#8217;s
an American table.&#8221;</p>

<p>He played pool and stolidly listened to her ripple
of comments. She had a natural disrespect
for the American army that flashed up. &#8220;The
men did all they could, I dare say, but, my God,
Gurdy, what thugs the officers were! Some of
them turned up at a garden party where the King
dropped in and he went to speak to one. The
thing was cleaning its nails in a corner and it
shook hands with its pocket knife in the other
hand. I fainted and Ronny Dufford lugged me
home in a taxi. I say, do let me have St. Ledger
Grant do a pastel of you. Dad would love it and
St. Ledger needs ten pounds as badly as any one in
Cheyne Walk.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s Sillijer?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>&#8220;Artist. Poor bloke who got patriotic and
lost a leg in the Dardanelles mess. Serve him
right and so on but he&#8217;s ghastly poor.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You a pacifist?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Rather!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s why you like the Scandinavians? Because
they stayed out?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Right. I forgive you though because you&#8217;re
young and simple and your legs are rather jolly in
those things.&#8221; She twisted her head to stare at
his leggings and the black hair rose, settled back
into its carved composure below the strong,
shaded lamp. The clear red of her lips parted as
she laughed, &#8220;Not a blush? Made the world
safe for democracy and aren&#8217;t proud of it? How
did your friends get through? That rather
sweet lad who used to come to lunch when you
were at school? Lacy&mdash;?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Lacy Martin. Lost a leg.&#8221;</p>

<p>She frowned. &#8220;Doesn&#8217;t matter so much for a
chap like that with billions but&mdash;the artists. I
must have St. Ledger do you. We&#8217;ll go there tomorrow.
I had Cosmo&mdash;Rand have himself
done.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gurdy made a shot and said, &#8220;Rand&#8217;s a much
prettier subject than I&#8217;d be.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t get coy, my lad! You&#8217;re rather imposing
and you know it.&mdash;Like to meet Gilbert
Chesterton? You used to read his junk. I can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
have you taken there. Never met him, myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No thanks.&mdash;What&#8217;s that bell?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dress for dinner. You can&#8217;t. I must.&mdash;I
say, you&#8217;re altogether different from what I
thought you&#8217;d be.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What did you think?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t possibly tell you but I&#8217;m damned
glad you&#8217;re not. The butler can make cocktails.
Dad taught him in nineteen seventeen.&#8221;</p>

<p>The butler brought him an evil mixture.
Gurdy emptied it into the fireplace and leaned on
the pool table wondering what Margot had expected.
It didn&#8217;t matter, of course. Yet she
might recall him as a sixteen year old schoolboy
much absorbed in polevaults and stiff with conceit
for some acquirements in English letters. How
people changed and how foolish it was to be surprised
at change! Sophomoric. Mark really
knew a pretty woman when he saw one. A man
of genuine taste outside the selection of plays.&mdash;She
must know London expertly. She must have
a sense of spectacle. She must meet all conditions
with this liberal, successful woman as a
guide. If she wanted a pastel made for Mark
she should have it. Gurdy dusted chalk from his
leggings, evenly taped about the long strength of
his calves, strolled into the drawing room and
played the languid movement of the Faun&#8217;s Afternoon.
Illusory or not there was always beauty in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
the blended exterior of things. A man should
turn from the inner crassness to soothe himself
with the fair investiture, with the drift of delicate
motions that went in colour and music.&mdash;Olive
thought him like Mark as she came in. She was
worried because Gail had written of meeting the
boy on Montmartre.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve been enjoying Paris?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;More or less. It&#8217;s a holy show, just now. I
don&#8217;t suppose the barkeepers&mdash;and other parasites&mdash;will
ever have such a chance again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope you&#8217;ve not been in too much mischief.
Ian Gail wrote me that he met you in some horrid
hole or other.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A party at Ariana Joyce&#8217;s. I wasn&#8217;t doing
any more harm there than the rest of the Allied
armies. But it was pretty odious.&#8221; The memory
jarred into the present satisfaction. He
halted his long fingers on the keys and Margot
came rustling in, her gown of sheer black muslin
painted with yellow flowers and gold combs in her
hair.</p>

<p>&#8220;Were you playing L&#8217;Après Midi?&mdash;And
he&#8217;s only twenty, Olive! Most Americans don&#8217;t
rise to respectable music until they&#8217;ve lost all
their money and have to come and live over
here. Any nails in your shoes, Gurdy? We&#8217;re
going to a dance.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where?&#8221; asked Olive.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>&#8220;Something for war widows at Mrs. Rossiter-Rossiter-Rossiter&#8217;s&mdash;that
fat woman from Victoria.
I promised some one or other I&#8217;d come.
We&#8217;ll go in time for supper.&#8221;</p>

<p>The charity dance seemed less fevered than
dances in Paris. There were ranks of matrons
about the walls of a dull, long room. At midnight
Margot rescued him from a girl who was
using him as an introduction to American economics
and found a single table in the supper
hall. Here the batter of ill played ragtime was
endurable and the supping folk entertained him.</p>

<p>&#8220;The country&#8217;s so ghastly with houses shut
and no servants that most people have stuck to
town,&#8221; Margot said, refusing wine. &#8220;Lot of
eminences here. Who&#8217;re you looking at?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The dark girl in pink. She&#8217;s familiar.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She should be. She has a press agent in
New York. Lady Selene Tucker. She&#8217;s going
to marry that man who looks like a Lewis Baumer
picture in Punch as soon as every one&#8217;s in
town again and she can get Westminster Abbey
and he can get his mother shipped to New Zealand,
or somewhere. His mother will drink too
much and then tell lies about Queen Victoria.
She&#8217;s rather quaint. She sues for libel every
time any one writes a novel with a dissolute
peeress in it. Frightfully self-conscious. Don&#8217;t
people who insist on telling you how depraved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
they are make you rather ill? They always
seem to think they&#8217;ve made such a good job of it.
And I could think of much worse things to do.&mdash;How
nice your hair is! Like Uncle Eddie&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thanks. Who&#8217;s the skinny woman with the
pearls?&#8221;</p>

<p>Margot put aside the palm branch that shadowed
her chin and frowned. &#8220;It looks like my
namesake, Mrs. Asquith, from this angle.&mdash;No,
it&#8217;s Lady Flint. Oh, look at the big brute in
mauve. Lovely, isn&#8217;t she?&#8221;</p>

<p>He looked at the shapely, fair woman without
interest. The round of Margot&#8217;s forearm
took his eyes back.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lovely? Why?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So glad you don&#8217;t think so. One gets so sick
of hearing women gurgled about as wonders. I
think it was Salisbury who said she was the most
beautiful woman alive. And she goes right on,
you know? Once you get fixed here as frightfully
beautiful or witty you can die of old age
before they stop saying so. Such a fraud!
It&#8217;s just what dad says about all the managers
and stars in New York being myths. All those
legends about his being a woman hater and&mdash;who&#8217;s
the man who&#8217;s supposed to never hire a
chorus girl until he&#8217;s seen her au naturel? Such
piffle!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But they like being myths,&#8221; Gurdy laughed.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>&#8220;Oh, every one does, of course. Some one
started a yarn about me&mdash;don&#8217;t tell dad this&mdash;that
I was the daughter of some frightfully rich
American banker and that my mother was a
Spanish dancer. Olive was wild with rage.
But it was rather fun.&mdash;I say, I&#8217;m sick of this,
Gurdy. Do make dad order me home.&#8221; She
lit a cigarette, let her lashes drop and ignored a
man who bowed, passing. Gurdy thought this
was Cosmo Rand and said so. Margot
shrugged. &#8220;He rehearses us every day. Decent
sort. People like him.&mdash;But do make dad
have me come home.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gurdy pondered. Mark now knew a few
gentlewomen, the wives of authors and critics.
He had mannerly friends outside the theatre,
had drilled smart war theatricals. The girl
could move beyond this wedge of certainty
wherever she chose. But Gurdy said, &#8220;You
might not like New York.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I want to see it! It&#8217;s hardly pleasant seeing
dad about once every year for two weeks or
so. I happen to love him. You mean I shan&#8217;t be
recognized as a human being by the fat ladies in
the Social Register? That&#8217;ll hardly break my
heart, you know? The world is so full of a
number&mdash;Is that God save the&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>The supping people rose in a vast puff of
smoke from abandoned cigarettes. Officers stiffened.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
The outer orchestra jangled the old
tune badly. The sleek gowns showed a ripple
of bending knees. The prince went nodding
down the room toward an inner door with a tiny
clink of bright spurs as his staff followed him.</p>

<p>&#8220;They say he&#8217;s going to the States. I should
like to be there to see the women make fools of
themselves. And Grandfather&#8217;ll be so furious
because every one&#8217;ll talk about a damned Britisher.&mdash;Finish
your coffee. I want to dance
again.&#8221;</p>

<p>She danced with a smooth, lazy rhythm and
Gurdy felt a brusque jealousy of all the men
who danced with her, after him. He was angry
because he so soon liked her, against reason. It
was folly to let himself be netted by a girl who
showed no signs of courting him. He watched
her spin, her black skirt spreading, with Cosmo
Rand. The man danced gracefully, without
swagger. He might be amusing, like many actors.
Gurdy pulled his philosophy together and
talked about Mark&#8217;s plan of the Walling
Theatre while they drove home.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dad&#8217;s wanted a shop of his own so long,&#8221;
she sighed, &#8220;And it&#8217;ll be quite charming. He
does understand colours! Wish he wouldn&#8217;t
wear black all the time.... I always feel fearfully
moral at two in the morning. I&#8217;m going to
lecture you.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>&#8220;What about?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re so damned chilly. You always were,
of course. Don&#8217;t you like anything?&#8221;</p>

<p>They came to the Ilden house before he could
answer and Margot didn&#8217;t repeat the question
all the week he stayed in London. They were
seldom alone. Lady Ilden seemed to want the
girl near her. There were incessant callers.
Men plainly flocked after the dark girl. Her
frankness added something to the wearisome
chaff of teatime and theatre parties, to the dazing
slang of the young officers. Gurdy speculated
from corners, edged in at random dances.
But his blood had caught a fresh pulsation. He
felt a trail of mockery in the artifice of Lady
Ilden&#8217;s talk as if the tired woman observed him
falling into love and found it humorous. She
said once, &#8220;I was afraid you&#8217;d grown up too fast.
And you&#8217;ve not,&#8221; but he let the chance of an
argument slide by his preoccupation with the
visible flutter of Margot&#8217;s hands pinning a tear
in her yellow frock. His resistance weakened
although he hunted repugnances, tried to shiver
when the girl swore.</p>

<p>&#8220;Profanity&#8217;s a sign of poor imagination,&#8221; he
told her.</p>

<p>&#8220;The hell you say,&#8221; said Margot. &#8220;Haven&#8217;t
turned out on the heavy side, have you, Gurdy?
I bar serious souls. War shaken you to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
foundations? Cheeryo! You&#8217;ll get over it.&#8221;
And she walked upstairs singing,</p>

Gurdy</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">IN mid March the lease of the ground in West
47th Street was brought to Mark&#8217;s office.
He signed it and gave the attorney his check.
A wrecking company was busy with the destruction
of the cheap hotel that stood where the Walling
Theatre would stand complete in November.
The notary and witnesses withdrew. Mark sat
drumming his fingers on his desk, trying to rejoice.
Irritations worked in him; Carlson would be the
only audience of his joy; the ground was bought
with money made too largely in moving pictures.
He was so close upon the fact grown from his
dream that it frightened him. The Walling was
real, at last. He should bubble with pleasure and
couldn&#8217;t. He sighed and strolled over to West
45th Street where he watched the final act of &#8220;Redemption&#8221;
for the sake of the dive scene, got his
usual happy shudder from this massed, intricate
shadow and the faces suddenly projected into the
vicious light. He must have such scenes at the
Walling. He must find somewhere a play made
of scenes, many and diverse, changing from splendour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
to dark vaults. Why, this was the secret of
the abominable movies! They jerked an audience
out of one tedious place into a dozen. He
walked toward Fifth Avenue, thinking, roused because
the streets seemed more speckled with olive
cloth. Some transport had disgorged soldiers
freshly into the city tired of gaping at them.
Mark enjoyed their tan in the crowded pace of
Fifth Avenue where women showed powder as
moist paste on their cheeks in a warmth like that
of May. A motion picture star detained him at
a crossing and haughtily leaned from her red, low
car demanding the rights of a play for her company.
Mark couldn&#8217;t follow the permutations
of these women. She had been a chorus girl one
met at suppers. Now she was superb in her vulgar
furs with a handsome young Jew beside her
and a wolfish dog chained on the flying seat.
Mark got himself away and came home to the
panelled library where Carlson was stretched under
three quilts on his wheeled chair gossiping
with an old comedian about the merits of Ada Rehan.
Soon the elderly caller left. Mark took
his chair by Carlson and wondered what he would
do if his patron died before Gurdy got back.
Carlson couldn&#8217;t last much longer, the doctors
said, but his mind was active. He yapped, &#8220;I&#8217;ve
got a hunch, sonny.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Go on.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>&#8220;You&#8217;re goin&#8217; to see Gurdy pretty dam&#8217; quick.
I had a nap before Ferguson came in. Dreamed
about the kid.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;d have cabled if he&#8217;d sailed,&#8221; Mark said,
&#8220;No, he&#8217;s still stuck in the mud at Saint Nazaire.
By God, it&#8217;s enough to make a man vomit, reading
about those damned embarkation camps!
And he ain&#8217;t an officer. They say the enlisted
men don&#8217;t even get enough to eat!&#8221; He suddenly
fumed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, don&#8217;t cry about it, you big calf,&#8221; said
Carlson, &#8220;Honest to God, I never saw a feller
that can cry like you do! You cried like a hose-pipe
when the kid got shot&mdash;and from all I hear
it wasn&#8217;t nothin&#8217; but a scratch on his belly. And
I used to spend hours trying to teach you to shed
one tear when you was actin&#8217;! You was the
punkest matiny idol ever drew breath of life!&#8221;</p>

<p>Mark chuckled, &#8220;I suppose I was,&#8221; then a hand
slid down over his shoulder and an olive cuff
followed it. Mark&#8217;s heart jumped. He dropped
his head back against Gurdy&#8217;s side and began
to weep idiotically as he had sworn to himself that
he wouldn&#8217;t. Old Carlson surveyed the end of
the trick delightedly. He privately cursed Gurdy
for standing still and pale when it was clearly the
right thing to make a fuss. The cub was too
cool.</p>

<p>&#8220;Son, son,&#8221; said Mark.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>Gurdy hoped that the man would not repeat
that illogical word in his husky, drumming voice.
The repetition brought the illusion of joy too
close. He chewed his lip and wriggled, gave in
and stooped over Mark. He got out, &#8220;Here,
I&#8217;ve not had any lunch, Mark,&#8221; and that turned
Mark into mad action, sent him racing downstairs
to find the butler.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why the hell didn&#8217;t you kiss him?&#8221; Carlson
snarled.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m twenty&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a hog,&#8221; the old man meditated. His
eyes twinkled. He sneered, &#8220;Well, wipe your
eyes. Here&#8217;s a handkerchief if you ain&#8217;t got
one.&#8221; He relished the boy&#8217;s blush, watched him
blink and went on, &#8220;Now, don&#8217;t tell Mark about
all the women you ruined, neither. He prob&#8217;ly
thinks you been a saint. And don&#8217;t go spillin&#8217;
any of this talk about goin&#8217; to work on your own
like some of these whelps do. Mark&#8217;s got a three
thousand dollar car comin&#8217; for you and he&#8217;s goin&#8217;
to pay you a hundred a week to set in the office
and look wise. And don&#8217;t tell him you didn&#8217;t win
the war, too. He knows you did. Christ, it was
bad enough when I&#8217;d got to listen to how Margot
was runnin&#8217; the Red Cross in London! After
you went off I come pretty near callin&#8217; up the express
company and havin&#8217; myself shipped to
Stockholm! The big calf! Chewin&#8217; the paint<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
off the walls every time he heard there&#8217;d been
fightin&#8217;! Sentymental lunatic! Your papa and
mamma&#8217;ve got three times more sense about you.
Get out of here. I got to make up sleep.&#8221;
He shut his eyes. Two tears ran and were lost in
the sharp wrinkles of his face. Gurdy gulped
and walked downstairs, abashed by the sheer
weight of idolatry.</p>

<p>Mark was twisting the cork out of a champagne
bottle in the dining room. At once he
said, &#8220;They&#8217;ll have some eggs up right away,
sonny.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My God but you&#8217;re thin, Mark!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No exercise. Haven&#8217;t had time to play golf.
Now, we&#8217;d better get the car and run down to
Fayettes&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I talked to mother from Camp Merritt. Be
in Camp Dix tomorrow. I&#8217;ll see them there.
They can motor over. Only twelve miles.
Heard from Margot lately?&#8221;</p>

<p>His uncle beamed saying, &#8220;Says she wants to
come home, son. I&#8217;ve got to talk to you about
that. What d&#8217;you think?&#8221;</p>

<p>Gurdy said quickly, &#8220;Let her come, Mark.
The fact is, I think she&#8217;s bored. You haven&#8217;t
seen her since last year? She&#8217;s got a gang of men
trailing after her and she isn&#8217;t a flirt. Chelsea&#8217;s
full of bright young painters and things. They
all come and camp on the doormat. Lady Ilden&#8217;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
a sort of fairy godmother, of course.&#8221; He
lapsed into a sudden state of mind about Margot,
fondling his glass of champagne. Untrimmed
discourse on women had amused his first days in
the army. But the week&#8217;s return in the jammed
transport had sickened him with the stuffy talk of
prospective and retrospective desire. It had been
musky, stifling. He wondered how women, if
they guessed, would value that broad commentary.
And how men lied about women! The
precisian was annoyed to a snort and Mark filled
his glass again, smiling.</p>

<p>Of course, having seen her, the boy wanted
Margot home. Mark said, &#8220;She wrote me you&#8217;d
turned out better looking than she thought.
Knew she&#8217;d think so. And Olive was pleased to
death with you, of course. How&#8217;s your side
feel?&mdash;My God, what are those fools doing to
the eggs!&#8221;</p>

<p>He rushed into the pantry. Rank pleasure
swelled in Gurdy. There was no use doing anything
with the incurable, proud man who drove
him back to Camp Merritt at dusk with two
bottles of champagne hidden in his motor coat, invited
confessions and beamed constantly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Only don&#8217;t act like you&#8217;d ever kissed a woman
in front of your mother, son. Country folks.
Shock her to death. You any taller? I&#8217;ll call up
Sanford about some clothes for you. Good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
night, sonny. You go straight to the farm when
you&#8217;re discharged. I&#8217;ll be down Sunday.&#8221;</p>

<p>An illusion of happiness beset Gurdy. He
stood in the green street of the half empty camp
staring after the motor, the wine bottles wrapped
in paper under his arm. It was astonishing how
foolish Mark was, to be sure. But wine or emotion
warmed the chill air about Gurdy like the
pour of a hot shower. If Mark wanted to be an
ass over him, it couldn&#8217;t be helped. He kept
thinking of his foolish worshipper in the transfer
to the sandy discomfort of Camp Dix. There the
Bernamers appeared in a large motor with grandfather
Walling furred and mittened in the back
seat. The illusion of happiness deepened into a
sensuous bath, although his mother had contracted
more fat and his sisters were too brawny
for real charm. Gurdy struggled for righteous
detachment while his brothers candidly goggled
their admiration and his father examined the purple
scar that passed dramatically up Gurdy&#8217;s
milky skin. He found himself blinking and got
drunk on the second bottle of champagne when his
family left. But it seemed wiser to surrender to
the flood of affectionate nonsense for a time. It
was even convenient that Mark should send a
tailor down to Fayettesville with clothes rapidly
confected. On Sunday Mark arrived with a
small car lettered G.B. in blue on its panel.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>&#8220;Just the blue Gurdy&#8217;s eyes are,&#8221; Mrs. Bernamer
drawled.</p>

<p>Gurdy understood that maternal feeling was a
rather shocking symbol on the charts of analysts
and that Mark probably doted on him for some
trivial resemblance unconsciously held and engrossed.
But it was pleasant, being a symbol.
He drove Mark down into Trenton and talked of
Margot while they drank bad American Benedictine
in a seedy hotel.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know whether she&#8217;s very clever or simply
sensible,&#8221; he said, achieving detachment by
way of Benedictine. &#8220;Anyhow, most cleverness
is just common sense&mdash;perception.&#8221; His eyes
darkened. Mark thought in lush comfort that
Gurdy would marry the girl. Gurdy had friends
among the right sort of people. Poor Carlson
would die pretty soon. Gurdy and Margot would
live at the house, which were best adorned freshly.
The Benedictine gave out. They drove into the
twisted lanes behind Trenton and Gurdy talked
levelly of France. &#8220;Damned humiliating to get
laid out by a hunk of zinc off a bathtub. Margot
joshed me about it.... Paris was perfectly
astonishing! American privates giving parties
for British admirals and stealing their women.&mdash;I
ran into a Y. M. C. A. girl who wanted to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
Fontainebleau made into a reform school. Margot
says she found one that wanted to have
George turn Windsor Castle into a hospital for
the A. E. F.... You mustn&#8217;t mind Margot
swearing. All the flappers seem to.&mdash;Oh, I met
Cora Boyle.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How&#8217;s she looking?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Handsome.&#8221; Gurdy thought for a second and
then inquired. &#8220;What did you&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Mark comprehended the stop. He said, &#8220;She
was the first woman ever took any notice of me.&mdash;Why,
I suppose she was a kind of ideal. I mean,
I liked that kind of looks. Lord knows what she
married me for. Wonder, is that Rand kid still
married to her? Is? I guess she&#8217;s settled down
in London for keeps. Well, I want you to look
at the plans of the Walling, son. They&#8217;ve made
me a model. Tell me if you see anything
wrong.&#8221;</p>

<p>He simmered with joy when Gurdy approved
the whole plan except the shape of the boxes.
The boy ran back and forth between Fayettesville
and the city in his car, asked seemly young men to
dine in Fifty Fifth Street, read plays and wandered
with Mark to costumers. People stared at
him in the restaurants where Mark took him to
lunch. His tranquil height and his ease drew
glances. His intolerant comments on the motley
of opening nights made Mark choke. Sometimes,
though, Mark found the boy&#8217;s eyes turned
on him with surprise.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>&#8220;You seem to hang out in Greenwich village a
lot, Mark.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I kind of like it. Don&#8217;t understand some of
the talk. The show business is changing, sonny.
It&#8217;s changed a lot since nineteen fourteen. If
you&#8217;d told me five years back that a piece like Redemption
could have a run I&#8217;d have laughed my
head off. Or that you could mount a play like
Jones has fixed up this thing at the Plymouth&mdash;all
low lights and&mdash;what d&#8217;you call it?&mdash;impressionist
scenery.... The game&#8217;s changed.&mdash;Oh, the
big money makers&#8217;ll always be hogwash, Gurdy!
Don&#8217;t bet any other way. I ain&#8217;t such a fool
as to think that Heaven&#8217;s opened because you can
put on a piece with a sad ending and some&mdash;well,
philosophy to it and have it make a little cash.
No such luck. Only it&#8217;s got so now that when
some big, fat wench in a lot of duds starts
throwin&#8217; his pearls back at the man that&#8217;s keepin&#8217;
her in the third act&mdash;why, there&#8217;s a lot of folks
out front that say, Oh, hell, and go home. Of
course, there&#8217;s a lot more that think it&#8217;s slick.&mdash;Lord,
I&#8217;d like to put on &#8216;Measure for Measure&#8217;
when we open the Walling!&mdash;You could make
that look like something.&mdash;I&#8217;ve got to find something
<i>good</i> to open with. This kid Steve
O&#8217;Mara&#8217;s sending me up a play about a thug
that gets wrecked down in Cuba and steals a plantation.
Ten scenes to it, he says. One of &#8217;em&#8217;s a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
lot of niggers havin&#8217; a Voodoo party. Sounds
fine. I picked <i>him</i> up down in Greenwich village.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should think all those half married ladies
and near anarchists would shock you to death.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bosh, brother. I don&#8217;t like &#8217;em enough to
get shocked at &#8217;em. What&#8217;s there to get shocked
at? They think so and so and I think the other
way. If you took to preaching dynamite I&#8217;d be
pretty worried&mdash;like I would if your mamma
bobbed her hair and ran off with a tenor. I&#8217;m
not an old maid just because I&#8217;m in the show business.&#8221;
He lit a cigarette and added. &#8220;Fifty
per cent of theatrical managers are old maids.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just what do you mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, they are. This way. They get used
to a run of plots and they can&#8217;t see outside that.
For instance, here&#8217;s a dramatist&mdash;forgotten his
name&mdash;was trying to sell a piece last year. I
couldn&#8217;t use it but I thought it was pretty good
so I sent him over to Loeffler with a note. Next
day, Loeffler called me up and said I ought to be
hung for the sake of public morals. This play
knocked round the offices and every one thought it
was awful. Why? The hero&#8217;s a chauffeur
that&#8217;s tired of working, so he marries a rich old
woman. It&#8217;s something that happens every
other day in the papers. There ain&#8217;t a week
that some fifty year old actress doesn&#8217;t marry a
kid step dancer but they all carried on as if this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
fellow&#8217;d written a play where every one came on
the stage stark naked and danced the hoochy coochee.
It wasn&#8217;t a nice idea but where&#8217;s it worse
than nine tenths these bedroom things or as bad?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why wouldn&#8217;t you use it, Mark?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, hell, there wasn&#8217;t but one scene and that
was an interior!&#8221;</p>

<p>Gurdy asked, &#8220;Mark, wouldn&#8217;t you like it if the
playwrights would go back to the Elizabethan
idea&mdash;I mean thirty or forty scenes to a play?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly,&#8221; said Mark, &#8220;and those bucks were
right.&#8221; He sat for a little silent, scrawling his
desk blotter with a pencil, then shyly laughed,
&#8220;Supposing some one made a play out of my married
life? What you&#8217;d call the important episodes
happened all over God&#8217;s earth. Cora got
me on a farm in Fayettesville, N. J., married in
Hoboken. Started quarreling in Martin&#8217;s café.
Caught her kissing a fellow at Longbranch.
Never saw him before or since. Owned up she&#8217;d
lived with three or four men in our flat&mdash;twentieth
Street, New York. Big scene. God, how
sick that made me! I was at tea at Mrs. LeMoyne&#8217;s
when Frank Worthing got me off in a
corner and told me about her and Jarvis Hope.
I was sittin&#8217; in the bath tub when she chucked her
curling irons at me and said she was through.
That&#8217;s the way things go. Shakespeare was right.
Crazy? No.&mdash;Come in.&#8221; His secretary brought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
Mark a thick manuscript lettered &#8220;Captain Salvador:
Stephen O&#8217;Mara.&#8221; and withdrew. Mark
went on, &#8220;But my married life wouldn&#8217;t make
much of a show&mdash;green kid from the country and
a&mdash;a Cora Boyle. Pretty ordinary.&#8221; He reflected,
&#8220;But I don&#8217;t know. It&#8217;s always going to
be pretty tragic for a kid to find out he&#8217;s married
a girl thinkin&#8217; she was pure&mdash;as pure as folks are,
anyhow&mdash;and finds she hadn&#8217;t been. Wasn&#8217;t her
fault, of course. Started acting when she was
fourteen. Awful jolt, though. She lied about
it, too. She was the damnedest liar! I hate
liars. Well run along and play squash or something,
sonny. I want to see what O&#8217;Mara&#8217;s
handed me.&#8221;</p>

<p>He bought the rights to &#8220;Captain Salvador&#8221;
two hours later. Gurdy was willing to rejoice
with him after he read the Cuban tragedy. Carlson
yapped, &#8220;The women&#8217;ll hate it, Mark.
Where&#8217;s your clothes?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bosh,&#8221; said Mark, &#8220;there weren&#8217;t any women&#8217;s
clothes in Ervine&#8217;s &#8216;John Ferguson&#8217; and
the women ate it alive!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But that fellow Ervine&#8217;s an Englishman, you
big calf! You ain&#8217;t going to open the Walling
with a sad piece by an American where there ain&#8217;t
any duds for the women to gawp at! You&#8217;re off
your head. Ain&#8217;t I told you a million times that
the New York woman won&#8217;t swallow a home<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
grown show that&#8217;s tragic unless it&#8217;s all dressed
up? Stop him, Gurdy!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a damned good play, sir,&#8221; said Gurdy.</p>

<p>He thought it high fortune that Mark should
find anything so adroit and moving for the Walling&#8217;s
first play. Some of the critics believed in
O&#8217;Mara&#8217;s talent. Several artists in scenery were
asked to submit designs. The pressmen began a
scattering campaign of notes on O&#8217;Mara and
hints about the play. A procession of comely
young women declined the best female part as
&#8220;unsympathetic.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That means no clothes to it,&#8221; Carlson sniffed.</p>

<p>&#8220;But they&#8217;re fools,&#8221; Gurdy insisted, &#8220;It&#8217;s a
good acting part.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My God,&#8221; the old man screamed, &#8220;don&#8217;t you
know that no woman wants a part where she can&#8217;t
show her shape off and wear pearls! And these
hens that got looks don&#8217;t have to act any more.
They go to California and get in the movies.
You talk like actresses were human beings!
Women don&#8217;t act unless they ain&#8217;t good lookin&#8217;
or&#8217;ve got brains. You&#8217;ll have to go a long ways
if you want a good lookin&#8217; wench for that part.
God, you keep talkin&#8217; like actin&#8217; was some kind of
an art! It ain&#8217;t. It&#8217;s a game for grown up kids
that they get paid for. An actor that&#8217;s got any
brains never gets to be more&#8217;n some one smart in
comedy. A tragedian&#8217;s nothin&#8217; but a hunk of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
mush inside his head. Catch a girl that&#8217;ll act
tragical when she can sit on a sofa in a Paris gown
and have some goop make eyes at her!&mdash;And
Mark&#8217;ll have a fine time at rehearsals makin&#8217; any
leadin&#8217; man wear a stubble beard and eat with his
knife, like in this play. Art!&#8221; and the old man
fell asleep snorting. Yet his bedroom behind the
panelled library was dotted with photographs of
dead actors and actresses. Sometimes his dry
voice trailed into a sort of tenderness when he
spoke of James Lewis or Augustin Daly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Softhearted as an egg,&#8221; said Mark, hesitated
and resumed, &#8220;He&#8217;s got fifty thousand
apiece for you and Margot in his will, sonny.
Rest of it goes to his sister&#8217;s children in Sweden.&mdash;What&#8217;s
this you were saying about running out
to Chicago?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d rather like to. Lacy Martin&mdash;remember
him? I roomed with him freshman year at college&mdash;Lacy
lost his leg in France. He&#8217;s rather
blue. His mother wrote me that she&#8217;d like me
to come out. I thought I would.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well.&mdash;I thought I&#8217;d surprise you with it.
Got a cable from Olive Ilden Thursday. Margot
sailed Friday. Ought to land day after tomorrow.&#8221;
He saw the orange level of Gurdy&#8217;s
cocktail flicker. Then the boy set it down and
brooded. Mark made his face stolid to watch
this. The butler served fish and retired without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
noise to his pantry. The tapestry of Chinese
flowers behind Gurdy&#8217;s chair stirred in the May
wind. The boy was immobile, fair and trim in
his chair. He seemed strangely handsome&mdash;a
long, easy lounging gentleman who hated sharp
emotions.</p>

<p>&#8220;Really think I&#8217;d better go out to Lake Forest,
Mark. I more or less promised I would. I
shan&#8217;t be gone more than a&mdash;couple of weeks.&#8221;</p>

<p>Triumph dragged a chuckle from Mark. He
covered it with, &#8220;Oh, sure! If Lacy&#8217;s got the
blues, run ahead out and cheer him up.&#8221; The
boy was in full flight from love, of course, and
didn&#8217;t want to admit it. Mark doted on him,
drawled, &#8220;Got all the money you&#8217;ll need?&#8221; and
was pleased by Gurdy&#8217;s confession that he needed
a good deal. He gave the boy errands about
Chicago to aid the retreat. &#8220;There&#8217;s a girl
named Marryatt playing at the La Salle. Some
of them think she&#8217;s got distinction. And poke
around and see if you can rake up a scenery man.
Take the directions for Captain Salvador along.
If you find any one that ain&#8217;t just copying Bobby
Jones or Gordon Craig make him send me
sketches. And there&#8217;s this poet on a newspaper&mdash;he&#8217;s
named something like Sandwich&mdash;no, Sanbridge.
See if he&#8217;s got a play up his sleeve.
O&#8217;Mara was talking about him.&#8221;</p>

<p>He saw Gurdy off for Chicago, the next noon,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
then set about making lists of successive luncheons
for Margot. This return must be an ample revenge
for her waygoing. She wasn&#8217;t, now, the
small girl whose presence in Miss Thorne&#8217;s school
had frightened matrons. She was some one protected
by his celebrity and trained by Olive Ilden.
He must contrive her content until she married
Gurdy. She was democratic&mdash;Olive had seen to
that. Mark had watched her chaff a knot of convalescent
soldiers in Hyde Park. She wouldn&#8217;t
care that one of his best friends had risen toward
management from the rank of a burlesque dancer,
that another had been an undertaker in Ohio.
She wouldn&#8217;t mind things like that. He marshalled
the cleverest of the critics and the young
women who dealt in publicity. Gurdy would
bring proper men to call, when he came back from
his flight. The expanse of her future opened
like an unfurling robe of exquisite colours. She
strolled in Mark&#8217;s mind most visibly. He
hummed, inspecting his house.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Carlson sneered, &#8220;she&#8217;s been footloose
amongst a pack of dukes and things and you think
she&#8217;s going to like bein&#8217; mixed up with a lot of&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She won&#8217;t mind,&#8221; said Mark.</p>

<p>She seemed to mind nothing. She landed on
the twentieth of that cool May, kissed Mark on
the nose and told him she had three cases of
champagne in the hold. The customs inspectors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
were dazzled stumbling among her trunks.
A file of other voyagers came to shake hands. A
great hostess kissed the girl, smiled at Mark and
said gently that she hoped Mr. Walling would
bring Margot to luncheon next fall.</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s quite nice,&#8221; Margot assured him in the
motor, &#8220;She probably kept your photograph with
a bunch of violets in a jar in front of it when you
were a matinée&mdash;Oh, how you hate that word!
How nice your nose is! Where on earth&#8217;s
Gurdy?&mdash;Lake Forest? Oh, that&#8217;s where all the
Chicago pig kings live, isn&#8217;t it? They have chateaux
and moats and exclude&mdash;But it&#8217;s rather rotten
he isn&#8217;t here. I&#8217;ve a couple of awful French
novels for him. He speaks such rather remarkable
French. I can&#8217;t make the right J sounds.
He&#8217;s such a stately animal. I was awfully
frightened of him in London. Such a ghastly
crossing!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, honey?&#8221;</p>

<p>She stared at him with wide black eyes and said
more slowly, &#8220;How nicely you say things like that.&mdash;You&#8217;re
really awfully glad I&#8217;m back, aren&#8217;t
you?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mark choked, &#8220;Here&#8217;s Times Square.&#8221;</p>

<p>She shrugged and leaned back on the blue cushions.
&#8220;Horrible! But the theatre district in
London&#8217;s worse, really. The Walling&#8217;ll be on a
side street, won&#8217;t it? I&#8217;d loathe seeing Walling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
in electric bulbs along here. Be rather as though
you were running about naked. Did I write you
about Ronny Dufford&#8217;s new play? Been a most
tremendous success. You should bring it over.
That&#8217;s the Astor, isn&#8217;t it? What colour&#8217;s the
Walling to be inside? Blue? Rather dark
blue? And swear to me that you won&#8217;t have
Russian decorations!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I swear, daughter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You old saint,&#8221; said Margot, &#8220;and you&#8217;re still
the best looking man in the known world!&#8221;</p>

<p>Her lips had a curious, untinted brilliance as
though the blood might burst from them. Dizzy
Mark told himself that she wasn&#8217;t the most beautiful
of women. Her brown face was like his face
and her father&#8217;s face, too flat. Her hands
weren&#8217;t small, either, but she wore no rings. Her
gown was dark and her tam o&#8217;shanter of black
velvet was inseparable from her hair in the mist
of his eyes. Silver buckles swayed and twinkled
when her gleaming feet moved about his house
and she smiled in a veil of cigarette smoke.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve simply natural good taste, dad.
Born, not made. Don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m keen on that
Venice glass in the dining room. Too heavy.
Where does Gurdy sleep?&mdash;I snore, you know?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe it. He sleeps on the top floor
where the old playroom was.&#8221;</p>

<p>She threw her head back to laugh and said,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
&#8220;Where he used to make such sickening noises on
the piano when he thought you were petting me
too much? He&#8217;s a dear. It wouldn&#8217;t be eugenics
for me to marry him, would it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;See that, Mark?&#8221; Carlson squealed, &#8220;She
ain&#8217;t been ten minutes in the country and she&#8217;s
huntin&#8217; a husband? That&#8217;s gratitude!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you,&#8221; said Margot, spinning on a heel,
&#8220;If you were ninety seven years younger I&#8217;d
marry you myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>She teased the old man relentlessly. She
teased Mark before his guests at the first luncheon.
Her variations appalled the man. She
seemed to know all the printable gossip of New
York. She spoke to older women with a charming
patience, played absurd English songs to
amuse Mark&#8217;s pet critic and got the smallest of
the managers in a loud good temper by agreeing
with his debatable views on stage lighting. Most
of these, his friends, had forgotten that she was
Mark&#8217;s niece. Their compliments were made as
on a daughter. He felt the swift spread of a
ripple; editors of fashion monthlies telephoned to
ask for photographs; the chief of a Sunday supplement
wanted her views on the American Red
Cross; a portrait painter came calling.</p>

<p>&#8220;Silly ass,&#8221; said Margot, &#8220;I met him in Devonshire.
I hate being painted. You&#8217;ve never had
a portrait done? Dreary. One has to sit and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
smirk.&#8221; She went fluttering a yellow frock up the
library to find an ash tray, came back smoking a
cigarette, neared Mark&#8217;s chair then veered off to
pat Carlson&#8217;s jaw.</p>

<p>&#8220;You used to set like a kitchen stove in one
spot for an hour at a time,&#8221; Carlson said, &#8220;Now
you&#8217;re all over the place.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;One has to move about in England to keep
warm. Dad, I wrote Ronny Dufford to send
you a copy of his play. Ronny&#8217;s land poor, you
know? It&#8217;s made mountains of money but I
don&#8217;t think he&#8217;s half out of debt, yet. Such a nice
idiot. He liked Gurdy such a lot. What the
deuce an&#8217; all is Gurdy doing in Chicago? Bargin&#8217;
about with the pigstickers?&#8221;</p>

<p>She shed her mixture of slangs when his
broker&#8217;s wife came to luncheon. Mark didn&#8217;t
think it affected that she mainly talked of titled
folk to the smart, reticent woman. Mrs. Villay
invited her to Southampton before leaving.
Margot shook her hair free of two silver combs
and shrugged as the front door shut. &#8220;I suspect
her of being a ferocious snob. Sweet enough,
though. Fancy she doesn&#8217;t read anything but
Benson and the late Mrs. Ward.&mdash;Oh, no, Mrs.
Ward isn&#8217;t late, is she? Simply lamented.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mark laughed, &#8220;Let&#8217;s go talk to Mr. Carlson.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You always call him Mister. Just why, darling?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>&#8220;Well, he&#8217;s forty years older than me, sister.
And he made me. He&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tosh! You made yourself! Let&#8217;s walk
over and see how the Walling&#8217;s getting on.&#8221;</p>

<p>He wallowed in this warm enchantment for ten
days. Margot dismissed herself to Fayettesville
on the first breath of heat. He went down to see
her established in the gaping adoration of the
family. He thought it hard on the Bernamer
girls. He had hinted boarding school for these
virgins but the Bernamers, trained by moving pictures,
were wary. Yet Margot was clearly born
to captivate women. He wrote to Gurdy at Lake
Forest: &#8220;It was nice to see her tone herself
down for your grandfather and your mother. I
told her she had better not smoke except with
your dad in the cowbarn. You kept telling me I
must not be shocked. What is there to get
shocked at? Young girls are not as prissy as
they were when I was a pup.&mdash;Hell of a row coming
on with the actors. We are trying to keep
things quiet but it looks like a strike. But some
of the men still think an actor is a cross between
a mule and a hog. Letter from Olive Ilden says
she is going to Japan pretty soon and will come
this way. I see in the London news that Cora
Boyle has signed up with the Celebrities and is
coming over to be filmed as Camille or The Queen
of Sheba. You are wrong about &#8216;Heartbreak<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
House.&#8217; It is a conversation, not a play. I wish
Shaw would do something like Cæsar and Cleopatra again.
They start work on the sets for
Captain Salvador next week at the studio. Shall
have two sets made for the Voodoo scene and try
both on the road before we open the Walling.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gurdy reflected that it was time to come home.
Then he put it off. Lake Forest was pleasant.
He was fond of his host. It was prudent to test
the pull of this feeling for Margot. The thing
augmented now that he couldn&#8217;t talk of her. A
strict detachment from passion was silly, after all.
But he was annoyed with himself as the passage
of any tall and blackhaired woman across a lawn
would interrupt the motion of his blood. He set
his brain tasks, meditated the girl at Fayettesville,
hoped that she wouldn&#8217;t singe the acute
American skin of his young brothers by comments
on the national arms. His sisters had probably
made their own experiments with cigarettes.
They were sensible lasses, anyhow, if given to
endless gush about moving pictures. His young
host&#8217;s sisters, amiable, blond girls were much the
same thing, rarified by trips to Europe, suave
frocks and some weak topics in the cerebral
change. They held Dunsany a fascinating dramatist
and thought there was something to be said
for communism. Chicago puzzled him with its
summer negligence and the candour of its wealth,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
with the air of stressed vice in the Loop restaurants
and the sudden change from metropolis to a
country town within the city limits. It seemed
absurd that the listless, polished wife of a hundred
million dollars should return from Long
Island to give a dance in honor of a travelling
English poet held lowly in Chelsea, described by
Olive Ilden as a derivative angleworm. At this
dance he heard of Margot from an unknown
woman with whom he waltzed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I saw you in London, last winter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was there. Funny I don&#8217;t remember&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You were in uniform with Margot Walling
and Lady Ilden. At a play. Margot was wearing
one of her yellow frocks. I was the other
side of the gangway. I wondered about you,
rather. Margot always snubs me. I&#8217;m a countess
of sorts and it always interests me when
Americans snub me.&mdash;Let&#8217;s get something to
drink. I don&#8217;t dance well and you must be in
torments&mdash;What&#8217;s your name?&#8221;</p>

<p>She was a lank, tired creature in a rowdy gown
sewn with false pearls that hissed theatrically as
she slumped into a chair on the lit terrace.</p>

<p>&#8220;Cousin, eh?&mdash;Well, Margot amuses me.
She&#8217;s the genuine aristocrat, you know? Take
what you want and to hell with the rest. Pity so
few Americans catch the idea. Imagine any continental
woman coming a thousand miles to give a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
dance for a cheapjack penny poet like this sweep.
Afraid he won&#8217;t mention her in his travel book,
I dare say. Run and get me a drink. Something
mild.&#8221; A youth at the buffet told him this was
the Countess of Flint. She sipped wine cup, refused
a cigarette and asked, &#8220;Where did you go
to school? Saint Andrew&#8217;s? My brothers did
Groton. Beautiful training wasted on the desert
air. That&#8217;s the trouble with the American game.
Did you ever think how much good it would have
done the beastly country to have had about four
generations of a hard and fast aristocracy&mdash;plenty
of money, no morals, quantities of manner? It&#8217;s
simply a waste of time and money to train lads
and then turn them loose in a herd of rich women
all afraid of their dressmakers. What a zero the
average American woman is!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hush,&#8221; he said, &#8220;That&#8217;s treason! You&#8217;ll be
shot at sunrise!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Unsalted porridge. Utter vacuum. Not a
vacuum either because she&#8217;s a bully, usually. And
a prude.&mdash;Is Margot going to marry Ronny
Dufford?&#8221;</p>

<p>Gurdy jumped, inescapably startled. He said,
&#8220;Colonel Dufford? The General Staff man who
writes plays? I&#8217;m sure I don&#8217;t know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It wouldn&#8217;t be a bad thing. Ronny&#8217;s all right&mdash;the
gentleman Bohemian touch and I dare say
she has money.&#8221; The lank woman coughed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
went on, &#8220;She&#8217;ll take on an Englishman in any
case, though.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s in New York.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, she&#8217;ll get fed with that directly and trot
home.&#8221; The woman locked her gaunt arms behind
her careless hair and yawned at the amber
moon above the clipped pines. &#8220;New York&#8217;s
frightful! Stuffed middle westerners squatting
in hotels trying to look smart. Place is absolutely
run by women. Getting more respectable
every time I go through. Haven&#8217;t had any patience
with New York since the Stanford White
murder. Imagine all the bloods running to cover
and swearing they&#8217;d never even met White because
he&#8217;d been shot in a mess about a woman!
Imagine it! I always bought Harding Davis&#8217;s
books after that because he had the sand to get up
and say he liked White, in print. But that&#8217;s
Egyptian history.&#8221; She began to cough fearfully.
The pearls clattered on her gown.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve taken cold.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. Cigarettes. Are you married?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good lord, no. Only been twenty-one a
couple of weeks.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How odd that must be! Twenty-one a couple
of weeks ago. And you went to France and got
shot. Singular child!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why singular?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;ve been amusing myself at Saranac&mdash;at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
a house party, with a social register and an army
list. A war where eighty per cent. of the educated
men&mdash;I mean the smart universities&mdash;the
bloods under thirty all went and hid themselves.
It&#8217;s not pretty.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Aren&#8217;t you exag&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not in the least. I had fifty American officers
convalescing at my husband&#8217;s place in Kent
and half of them were freight clerks from Iowa.
What can you expect when the American woman
brings her son up to be a coward and his father
makes him a thief? And naturally the women
despise the men. Who on earth wants an American
husband?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They seem to find wives, somehow.&#8221;</p>

<p>She coughed, rising, &#8220;Oh, travel&#8217;s expensive.&#8221;
Then she gestured to the orange oblongs of the
ballroom windows. &#8220;D&#8217;you think any one of those
women would hesitate a minute between being the
next lady of the White House or the mistress of
the Prince of Wales? Of course not! Give
Margot my love. Good-bye. Too chilly out
here.&#8221; She rattled away.</p>

<p>Gurdy dropped into the chair and stared after
her. He should tabulate this woman at once
with her romantic illusions of aristocracy and
patriotism. Margot supervened and seemed to
move across the moony stones of the terrace.
He thought frantically of Colonel Dufford. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
thought solidly of marriage for ten minutes.
Beyond doubt he was in love with Margot. He
stirred in the chair, repeating maxims. Passion
wasn&#8217;t durable. He might tire of her. He argued
against emotion and blinked at the gold
lamps on the bastard French face of this house.
He was too young to select sensibly, didn&#8217;t want
to be sensible, suddenly. His pulse rose. He marvelled
at love. In the morning he announced his
present departure. At noon he had a special delivery
letter from his youngest brother, Edward
Bernamer, Junior, a placid boy of thirteen interested
in stamp collecting. The scrawl was the
worse for that complacency.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear Gurd, For the love of Mike come on
home and help take care of Margot E. Walling.
She has got mamma and the girls all up in the air.
Grandfather is getting ready to shoot her. I
heard him talking to dad about writing Uncle
Mark to take her away. I sort of like her.
Eggs and Jim think she is hell.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gurdy came whirling east to New York and
found Mark at the 45th Street Theatre, humming
over the model for a scene of &#8220;Captain Salvador.&#8221;
But plainly Mark knew nothing of any
fissure in the sacred group at Fayettesville. He
was busy rehearsing a comedy, had been to the
farm only once. In any event Mark mustn&#8217;t be
hurt. Gurdy took breath and delicately put<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
forth, &#8220;I want you to do something damned extravagant,
Mark.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Easy, sonny. Just got the estimate for the
mirrors at the Walling. Not more than ten
thousand, please!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not as bad as that. Get a cottage on Long
Island for July and August. The farm&#8217;s all
right for Margot for a while. But grandfather
goes to bed at nine. The kids play rags on the
phonograph all afternoon. It gets tiresome
after a while. I&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, son,&#8221; said Mark, &#8220;I&#8217;m not so thickheaded
I can&#8217;t see that sister&#8217;ll get bored down there.&#8221;
He beamed, thinking Gurdy superb in grey
tweeds, his white skin overlayed with pale tan.
&#8220;No, I expect I&#8217;d get bored with the cows and
chickens if I was there enough.&mdash;And we ought to
have some kind of a country place of our own.&mdash;There&#8217;s
some friend of Arthur Hopkins has a
place on Long Island he wants to let.&mdash;Olive
Ilden&#8217;ll be here in July and we ought to have a
cottage somewhere. I don&#8217;t think your dad and
Olive&#8217;d have much to talk over.&#8221; Mark grinned.
Gurdy laughed, curling on a corner of the desk,
approving the man&#8217;s common shrewdness. Mark
patted his palms together. &#8220;Look, you pike on
down to the farm. Margot&#8217;s got your car there.
You fetch her up in the morning and you two go
look at this cottage. I&#8217;ll &#8217;phone Hopkins and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
find where it is. Oh, here&#8217;s this piece Margot&#8217;s
friend Dufford&#8217;s sent over. I hear it&#8217;s doing a
fair business in London but nothing to brag of.
Read it and see what you think. Get going, son.
You can catch the three o&#8217;clock for Trenton.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gurdy strove with this fragility in neat prose
all the way to Trenton. It had to do with a
climber domiciled by mistake in the house of a
stodgy young Earl. It was wordy and tedious.
The name, &#8220;Todgers Intrudes,&#8221; made him grunt.
He laughed occasionally at the tinkling echoes of
Wilde and Maugham. It might be passable in
London where the lethal jokes on &#8220;Dora&#8221; and
&#8220;Brass Hats&#8221; would be understood. He diligently
tried to be just to Colonel Dufford&#8217;s art
which served to keep his pulse down and his mind
remote from the approaching discomfort. Margot
wasn&#8217;t perfect. She had upset the family.
It was best to get her quickly away from Fayettesville.
He hired a battered car at Trenton. The
Fayettesville Military Academy was closing for
the summer, by all signs. Lads bustled toward
the station towing parents and gaudy sisters in
the beginning of sunset. He overtook his three
brothers idling home toward the farm and gave
them a lift. No one spoke of Margot directly.
Edward, his correspondent, smiled sideways at
Gurdy and drawled, &#8220;Must have been having a
damn good time in Chicago, Gurd,&#8221; but nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
else was said. The car panted into the stone
walled dooryard. His grandfather waved a
linen clad arm at Gurdy from the padded chair
on the veranda. His sisters accepted the usual
candy and hid a motion picture magazine from
him, giggling. Mrs. Bernamer was at a funeral
in Trenton. Gurdy found Bernamer in the dairy
yard studying a calf. It was always easy to be
frank with the saturnine, long farmer. His
father didn&#8217;t suffer from illusions. They sat on
the frame of the water tower and lit cigarettes,
before speech.</p>

<p>&#8220;How&#8217;s Margot been behaving, dad?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You sweet on her, son?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I like her. How&#8217;s she been acting?&#8221;</p>

<p>Bernamer pulled his belt tight and lifted his
hard face toward the sky. Gurdy felt the mute
courtesy of his pause. The man had a natural
scorn of tumult. He lived silently and, perhaps,
thought much. He said, &#8220;This is just as much
Mark&#8217;s place as it is ours. He&#8217;s the best feller
livin&#8217;. We all know that. And she&#8217;s Joe&#8217;s
daughter.&#8221; Something boiled up in his blue eyes.
He cried, &#8220;What in hell! You&#8217;re as good as she
is, ain&#8217;t you? You can come home and act like
we wasn&#8217;t mud underfoot! Who the hell&#8217;s she?&#8221;
His wrath slid into laughter. He pulled his belt
tighter and winked at Gurdy. &#8220;It&#8217;s kind of
funny hearin&#8217; her cuss, though.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>&#8220;She over does that, a little. Just what&#8217;s the
trouble, dad?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t tell you, son. She&#8217;s sand in the cream.
It ain&#8217;t her smokin&#8217;. I miss my guess if the girls
ain&#8217;t tried that.&mdash;She kind of puts me in mind of
that Boyle wench Mark married. She&#8217;s got the
old man all worried. Your mamma&#8217;s scared to
death of her. So&#8217;s the girls.&mdash;She ain&#8217;t so
damned polite it hurts her any.... Say, I
wouldn&#8217;t hurt Mark&#8217;s feelings for the world&mdash;And
I notice she don&#8217;t carry on so high and
mighty when Mark&#8217;s here, neither.&mdash;Ain&#8217;t there
some place else she could go?&#8221;</p>

<p>Gurdy had a second of futile rage that divided
itself between Margot and his family. This
wasn&#8217;t within remedy. She had absorbed the
attitudes, the impatience of worlds exterior to the
flat peace of the farm. He grinned at his father.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. I&#8217;m going to take her off. Mark&#8217;s got
more sense than you think, dad.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure. Mark&#8217;s got plenty of sense when he
ain&#8217;t dead cracked over a thing. Don&#8217;t tell him
I&#8217;ve been squalling. Mebbe that Englishwoman
spoiled her, lettin&#8217; her gallivant too much.
Mebbe it&#8217;s her father comin&#8217; out in her. Between
us, Joe was tougher&#8217;n most boys. You&#8217;ll
likely find her down in the orchard smokin&#8217; her
head off. It&#8217;s all kind of funny ... and then it
ain&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>She wasn&#8217;t smoking. She sat with a novel
spread on her yellow lap and the bole of an apple
tree behind her head. There was a shattered
plate of ruddy glow about her. The pose had
the prettiness of a drowsy child. She was, her
lover thought, a bragging child, lonesome for
cleverness, annoyed by stolidity. In the vast
green of the orchard she seemed small. He whistled.
She rose, her hair for a moment floating,
then laughed and threw the book away.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank God, that&#8217;s you! I thought it was
one of&mdash;O, any one!&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a shrill, unknown jerk in her voice.
She came running and took his arm.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell me something about civilization&mdash;quick!
You don&#8217;t want to talk about the fil-lums do you?
Or whether Jane Rupp&#8217;s going to marry that Coe
feller or&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bored?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh&mdash;to death! How do you stand it?
How do you stand it?... I knew they&#8217;d be
common but I didn&#8217;t think they&#8217;d be such
bloody&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Look out,&#8221; said Gurdy.</p>

<p>But the girl&#8217;s red lips had retracted. She was
shivering. She had lost her charm of posture.
She cried, &#8220;Oh, yes! They&#8217;re our people and all
the rest of that tosh! I&#8217;m not a hypocrite. It&#8217;s
a stable! A stable!&#8221; Her breath choked her.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
She gasped, &#8220;Get me out of here! I&#8217;m used to
what you call real people!&#8221;</p>

<p>She loosed his sleeve and patted her hair. But
some inner spring shook her. Scarlet streaks appeared
in her face. She babbled, &#8220;He must be
mad! Of course he&#8217;s sentimental about them&mdash;about
the place&mdash;the old place&mdash;It&#8217;s the way he is
about Carlson! My God, why should he think I
can stand it!&#8221;</p>

<p>Something hummed in Gurdy&#8217;s head. His
hands heated. He stood shuffling a foot in the
grass and looked from her at the green intricate
branches. He must keep cool. He whispered,
&#8220;Can&#8217;t you find anything&mdash;well, funny in it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all funny rather the way an old dress is!&mdash;Why
should he think I could stay here?
Three weeks! Of course, he hasn&#8217;t any breed&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shut up,&#8221; said Gurdy, &#8220;That&#8217;ll be all! We
were born here. Mark took us and had us
dressed and looked after&mdash;trained. I&#8217;m not going
to laugh at them. I can&#8217;t.&mdash;I&#8217;ll be damned
if I&#8217;ll hear you laugh at Mark. Yes, he&#8217;s sentimental!
If he wasn&#8217;t, d&#8217;you think he&#8217;d have
bothered about taking care of you&mdash;of us? The
family&#8217;s sacred to him. He loves them. He&#8217;s
that kind.&mdash;Stop laughing!&#8221;</p>

<p>He hated her. There was no beauty left.
Her face had shrivelled in this fire. She was
swiftly and horribly like an angry trull. She said,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
&#8220;Sentimentalist! You&#8217;re a damned milk and
sugar sentimentalist like&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah,&#8221; said Gurdy, &#8220;that&#8217;s out of some book!...
All right. Mark&#8217;s going to take a place on
Long Island. We&#8217;ll go up in the morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>He tramped off. The orchard became a whirl
of green flame that seared then left him cold.
He was tired. His body felt like stone, heavy
and dead. The illusion of desire was gone out of
Gurdy.</p>

Todgers Intrudes</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">OLIVE ILDEN was detained and surrendered
her mid July sailing. Her brother
died. This did not grieve her; they had
been on strained terms. But she was unwilling to
offend his daughters. Offence had grown hateful
with years. The personal matter flung to and fro
among critics wearied her. It wasn&#8217;t amusing to
hear that an elderly novelist was &#8220;a doddering
relic of the Victorian era.&#8221; She envisaged the
man&#8217;s pain. Thus, she bore the formalities
of her brother&#8217;s passing and so missed three
liners. About her, London recaptured something
of its tireless motion. She wished for Margot
and the youth Margot had kept parading through
the quiet house. She hoped that the girl&#8217;s frankness
never shocked Mark and puzzled again over
the rise of that frankness. In her first two English
years the child had been sedate, almost solemn,
reading a great deal and talking primly. Then
her conversation had risen to a rattle. It must be
rattling mightily in New York which Olive still
fancied a place of cheerful freedom. Letters recorded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
the change from Fayettesville to a cottage
on the Long Island shore: &#8220;Cottage was frightful
but dad behaved quite as if he was mounting a
play in a hurry. We drove from shop to shop and
all the stuff came roaring along in motor trucks.
I went to Southampton and camped with a rather
nice woman, Mrs. Corliss Stannard, who picked
me up coming across. It was dull as Westminster
Abbey as every one kept cursing the Prohibition
amendment. But dad had the cottage&mdash;(fourteen
rooms and four baths)&mdash;all decorated by the
time I got back. Some decentish friends of Gurdy
live near here. The men are all Goths and the
women are fearfully stiff but a broker proposed
last night at a dance and I felt rather silly, as he
has just been divorced two days and I hardly
knew his name. But dad has bought an option
to &#8216;Todgers Intrudes.&#8217;&#8221; Then, &#8220;Dad very busy
in town. The actors are threatening a strike.
Gurdy pretends that he does not like &#8216;Todgers Intrudes.&#8217;
For a man who did a smart school and
who knows his way about Gurdy is rather heavy.
Rather decent lunch today. Dad brought down
one of the other managers who talks through his
nose and is a duck. He taught me how to do a
soft shoe step.&#8221; And later, &#8220;Dad very émotionné
about a tragedy he is putting on in the autumn.
It is rather thrilling. He means to open
The Walling with it. Gurdy does not fancy &#8216;Todgers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
Intrudes.&#8217; He thinks himself a Bolshevik or
something and I dare say the county family business
in it annoys him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Immediately after this, while the letter was
fresh in mind Olive met Ronald Dufford on Regent
Street. He took her congratulations on the
American sale of his play with a dubious air,
swung his stick and said, &#8220;Thanks. Fancy Margot
made her guv&#8217;nor take it on. Between ourselves
it hasn&#8217;t more than just paid. You&#8217;re going
to the States, aren&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Next week. Yes, I think Margot had her
father buy the play, Ronny. It&#8217;s my sad duty to
warn him that it hasn&#8217;t been what the Yankees
call a three bagger&mdash;whatever that means.&#8221;</p>

<p>The playwright grinned amiably, saying,
&#8220;Rather wish you would. My things haven&#8217;t
done well in the States. I&#8217;m not so keen on being
known as a blight, out there. Walling&#8217;s
paid me two hundred pounds, no less, for American
rights. Charitable lad he must be!&mdash;I say,
I hear that Cossy Rand&#8217;s gone over to play for
him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s Cossy Rand?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Cora Boyle&#8217;s little husband. Nice thing.
You&#8217;ve met him? He rehearsed us for that
thing of mine at Christmas. A thin beggar
with&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>&#8220;Of course. I&#8217;ve even danced with him but he
passed out of the other eye.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But isn&#8217;t it rather odd for Walling to take on
his ex-wife&#8217;s present husband? Bit unusual?
You&#8217;ve always told me that Walling&#8217;s a conservative
sort.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why shouldn&#8217;t Walling take him on, Ronny?
The man&#8217;s rather good, isn&#8217;t he?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fairish. Frightfully stiff. He played the
Earl in &#8216;Todgers&#8217; while Ealy was fluing.&mdash;What
I meant was that it seems odd Walling should
cable him to come over. But I&#8217;ll be awfully
bucked if old &#8216;Todgers&#8217; gets along in the States.
&#8217;Tisn&#8217;t Shaw, you know?&#8221;</p>

<p>Olive was lightly vexed with Margot. The
girl was irresponsible when she wanted something
for a friend. But the trait was commendable;
Olive still ranked personal loyalty higher than
most static virtues. But &#8220;Todgers Intrudes&#8221; was
a dreary business. She spoke of it to Mark when
he met her at the New York pier. The idolator
chuckled.</p>

<p>&#8220;The actors have struck. I hope Margot&#8217;ll
forget about the thing before the strike&#8217;s over.
She likes Dufford? Well, that&#8217;s all the excuse
she needed. She isn&#8217;t&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you letting her stamp on your face, old
man?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>&#8220;It don&#8217;t hurt. She don&#8217;t weigh a heap. She
says Dufford&#8217;s poor.&#8221;</p>

<p>His eyes were dancing. He wore a yellow
flower in his coat and patted Olive&#8217;s arm as he
steered her to the lustrous blue car. &#8220;We&#8217;ll go
up to my house for lunch. Mr. Carlson&#8217;s crazy to
see you. Mustn&#8217;t mind if he curses at you. We&#8217;ll
go on down to the shore after lunch. Where&#8217;s
Sir John, m&#8217;lady?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Malta. Shall I see Gurdy? The nicest
child!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ain&#8217;t he? I&#8217;ve got him reading plays.&#8221; Mark
soared into eulogies, came down to state, &#8220;This
is Broadway,&#8221; as the car plunged over the tracks
between two drays.</p>

<p>&#8220;If that&#8217;s Broadway,&#8221; Olive considered, &#8220;I
quite understand why half of New York lives in
Paris. I do want to see Fifth Avenue. The sky-scrapers
disappointed me but Arnold Bennett says
Fifth Avenue&#8217;s really dynamic.&#8221; A moment after
when the car faced the greasy slope of asphalt she
said, &#8220;Bennett&#8217;s mad.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mark sighed, &#8220;It&#8217;s an ugly town. But this
street&#8217;s nice at sunset, in winter. It turns a kind of
purple.... It was bully when the women wore
violets. They don&#8217;t wear real flowers any more.&mdash;You
used to smell violets everywhere. Violets
and furs and cigar smoke. I used to like it.&#8221;
His eyes sparkled on the revocation. He smiled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
at the foul asphalt and the drooping flags of
shops where the windows gave out a torturing
gleam.</p>

<p>&#8220;You great boy,&#8221; said Olive.</p>

<p>&#8220;Boy? Be forty-one the second of November.&mdash;Oh,
awful sorry about your brother, Olive.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not. Gerald was null and void. I never
even discovered where he found the energy to
marry and beget daughters. Margot&#8217;s lived more
at the age of eighteen than Gerald had at fifty.
I don&#8217;t suppose that you can understand how I can
slang my own family.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, sure. Because my folks are all nice it
don&#8217;t follow I think every one ought to be crazy
about theirs. Did he have a son?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. The land goes to our cousin&mdash;Shelmardine
of Potterhanworth&mdash;that idiot his wife
pushed into Peerage. She was one of the managing
Colthursts. Loathsome woman. Her son&#8217;s
a V.C. though.&mdash;Oh, this improves!&#8221; The car
passed Forty Fifth Street. Olive gazed ahead,
cheered by the statelier tone of the white avenue.
Mark wondered how a woman who had lost both
children could yet smile at the dignity of Saint
Patrick&#8217;s and again at the homesick bewilderment
of her maid getting down before his house.</p>

<p>Old Carlson bobbed his head to this lady, abandoning
his ancient fancy that she had been Mark&#8217;s
mistress. He studied her grey hair and the worn,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
sharp line of her face. Then he cackled that she
was to blame for turning Margot into a &#8220;sassy
turnip.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My dealings with turnips have always been
conducted through a cook. Has she been shocking
you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ma&#8217;am,&#8221; said Carlson, &#8220;You can&#8217;t shock me.
I was in the show business from eighteen sixty-nine
to nineteen fourteen. I lugged a spear in
the &#8216;Black Crook&#8217; and I was a gladyator when the
Police arrested McCullough for playin&#8217; Spartacus
in his bare legs. No, Margot can&#8217;t shock me any
more&#8217;n a kitten.&#8221; He rolled a cigarette shakily,
spilling tobacco on his cerise quilt. Olive held a
match for him. He coughed, &#8220;But you&#8217;d ought
of seen her ballyrag Mark into buyin&#8217; this English
piece&mdash;What the hell do you call it, Mark?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Todgers Intrudes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a name for you! Gurdy don&#8217;t like it.
I say it&#8217;s hogwash. Maggie, she set on a table
smokin&#8217; her cheroot and just made the big calf
buy it.... She did, Mark. So don&#8217;t stand
there lookin&#8217; like Charlie Thorne in &#8216;Camille&#8217;!&#8221;</p>

<p>Mark was stirring with laughter at the old
man&#8217;s venom. He said, &#8220;I told Olive Margot
made me buy it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; Olive said, &#8220;if you let Margot run your
affairs you&#8217;ll have strange creatures from darkest
Chelsea mounting all your plays and flappers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
who&#8217;ve acted twice in a charity show playing
Monna Vanna. She made my poor husband buy
a cubist portrait of Winston Churchill some pal of
hers painted. When he found it was meant to be
Churchill he took to his bed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Hopkins, Mr. Williams,&#8221; said the butler
against Mark&#8217;s swift, &#8220;Ask &#8217;em to go to the drawing
room. &#8217;Xcuse me, Olive. Got to go talk
strike a minute.&#8221;</p>

<p>She looked about the sinless library with its
severe panels and blue rug then at Mark&#8217;s patron&mdash;an
exhumed Pharaoh, his yellow hawk face and
bloodless hands motionless, the cigarette smoking
in a corner of his mouth. He had just the pathos
of oncoming death. He squeaked, &#8220;Mark&#8217;s busy
as a pup with fleas. Actors strikin&#8217;! The lazy
hounds! It&#8217;s enough to make Gus Daly turn in
his grave!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve no sympathy with them?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not a speck! The show business is war and
war&#8217;s hell. Here&#8217;s this Boyle onion Mark was
married to, Bill Loeffler sends for her to come
back from England and get a thousand a week to
play in a French piece. Pays her passage. Then
what? Minute she sets foot on land she grabs
a movie contract and pikes off to California.
She&#8217;s a hot baby, she is! Actors!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hear that Mark&#8217;s engaged her husband.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That slimjim sissy from Ioway? Not much!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>&#8220;Is Rand an American?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He-ell, yes! He&#8217;s old Quincy Rand&#8217;s Son
that used to run the Opera House in Des Moines.
He run off with a stock comp&#8217;ny that played Montreal
and got to talkin&#8217; English. I told Margot
that and she was mad enough to bust.&mdash;Say, you
British are cracked, lettin&#8217; a pack of actors loose
in your houses like they was human&mdash;&#8221; He fell
asleep. The nurse came to take the cigarette
from his lips. Olive strolled off to examine the
shelves packed tightly with books. Here was the
medley of Mark&#8217;s brain&mdash;volumes of Whyte
Melville mingled with unknown American novels,
folios on decoration, collected prints from the
European galleries. A copy of &#8220;Capital&#8221; surprised
her but she found Gurdy&#8217;s signature dated,
&#8220;Yale College, November, 1916,&#8221; on the first
page. Gurdy came up the white stairway and
saw the black gown with relief. Lady Ilden
could be a buffer between Margot and himself.
There would be less need of visits to the seashore
house. He led the Englishwoman into the broad
hall.</p>

<p>&#8220;Something odd has just happened, Gurdy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Carlson swear at you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Before, not at. But he tells me that Mark
did not send for Cosmo Rand to act in something
over here whereas Ronny Dufford most distinctly
told me that Mark did. It interested me because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
Mark&#8217;s so coy about his old wife and it seemed
queer that he&#8217;d cable for her husband.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I expect Rand&#8217;s lying a little, for advertisement.
No, Mark didn&#8217;t send for him. He
never engages people to come from England.
Has Rand come over? According to Margot
he&#8217;s such an idol in London that it&#8217;d take an act
of Parliament to get him away. Miss Boyle&#8217;s
here. We saw her at lunch in the Algonquin and
she patronized Mark for a minute. Didn&#8217;t Rand
play some part in this &#8216;Todgers Intrudes&#8217; piffle
in London?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Which reminds me,&#8221; said Olive, &#8220;Margot
made Mark take that? Is she making him cover
her with emeralds and give masked balls?&#8221;</p>

<p>Gurdy said honestly, &#8220;No, not at all. We&#8217;ve
had some house parties&mdash;some friends of mine
and some of the reviewers and so on. She seems
to be amusing herself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And she hasn&#8217;t shocked Mark?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why should she?&#8221; Gurdy laughed, leaning on
the white handrail, &#8220;she doesn&#8217;t do any of the
things he dislikes seeing women do. She doesn&#8217;t
drink anything, for instance, and she doesn&#8217;t
paint. When did she go in for pacifism&mdash;not
that I&#8217;ve any objection to it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That was a way of helping me out when my
boy fell, I think. She raged about the war as a
sort of outlet for me. Really, she enjoyed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
war tremendously. As most girls did. Is she still
raving about the slaughter of the artist?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The slaughter of actors. Some Englishman&mdash;an
actor&mdash;said that too many actors slacked
and she lit on him. He mentioned half
a dozen&mdash;can&#8217;t remember them.&mdash;You told me in
London that she wanted to act?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. Has she been teasing Mark&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. But I think she could.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear boy, I&#8217;ve seen her in amateur things
twice and she was appalling! Vivacity isn&#8217;t
ability. Of course she has a full equipment in the
way of looks.&mdash;You mustn&#8217;t get dazzled over
Margot, Gurdy.&#8221; His face was blank. Olive
chanced a probe. &#8220;I forbid you to fall in love
with her, either. You&#8217;re cousins and it&#8217;s not
healthy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not thinking of it,&#8221; said Gurdy, red, and
so convinced Olive that he was deep in love. But
the dying blush left him grave. He stood listening
to the slow drawl of Mark&#8217;s voice below them
and wondering what tone would overtake its
husky music if Margot should turn on the worshipper,
screaming and hateful. He wondered at
himself, too. His passion had blown out. It
had no ash, no regret. He was free of anger,
even, and he had done the girl mental justice.
He didn&#8217;t want her back.</p>

<p>&#8220;You look rather done up, old man.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>&#8220;War nerves. We&#8217;ve all got them. And I&#8217;m
reading plays and some of them make me howl.
Such awful junk! &#8216;Don&#8217;t, don&#8217;t look at me like
that. I&#8217;m a good woman, and you have taken
from me the only thing I had to love in the whole
world.&#8217; That sort of stuff. And the plays for reform
are as bad as the ones against it. I don&#8217;t
know why people always lose their sense of
humour when they start talking economics!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Old man, when you&#8217;ve lived to be forty you&#8217;ll
find out that only one person in a thousand can
resist a sentimentalism on their side of the
question. And it&#8217;s almost always a sentimentalist
who writes plays on economics. But you do look
seedy. Are you coming to the country with us
after luncheon?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>

<p>But he drove with Mark and Olive to the half
finished front of The Walling in West 47th
Street. Mark pointed out the design of Doric
columns and bare tablets. Olive guessed at a
simple richness and stared after Mark when he
walked through groups of hot, noisy workmen
into the shadow of his own creation. His black
height disappeared among the girders and the
dust of lime.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did it all himself,&#8221; said Gurdy. &#8220;The architects
just followed what he wanted done.&mdash;You
called him a kid with a box of paints. You<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
should see him fuss over a stage setting!&mdash;D&#8217;you
know&mdash;my father&#8217;s an awfully observant man.
He was talking about Mark the other day. Dad
says that when Mark was a kid he used to draw
all the time. And they&#8217;ve got some pictures he
drew in old school books and things. They&#8217;re
not bad. Dad says that before Mark married
Cora Boyle and came to New York they all
thought he was going to turn out an artist.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it true that his whole success is because he
decorates plays so well?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. The truth is, he&#8217;s an awfully good business
man. And I&#8217;ve seen enough of the theatre
to see that some of the managers and producers
aren&#8217;t any good at business. They mess about
and talk and&mdash;He&#8217;s coming back.&#8221;</p>

<p>She saw Gurdy&#8217;s eyes centre on Mark with a
queer, tense look. The boy stood on the filthy
pavement studying the theatre as the car drove
east.</p>

<p>&#8220;Crazy about the place,&#8221; said Mark, brushing
his sleeve, &#8220;I do think people will like it, Olive.
Won&#8217;t be so dark that they can&#8217;t read a program
or so light the women&#8217;ll have to wear extra paint.&mdash;My
God, I&#8217;m glad Margot don&#8217;t daub herself
up! Well, she don&#8217;t have to. And I&#8217;m glad
she don&#8217;t want to act.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; Olive asked, &#8220;You were an actor.
You live entirely surrounded by actors. It&#8217;s an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
ancient and honourable calling&mdash;much more so
than the law or the army.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mark rubbed his short nose and grinned.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m just prejudiced. I suppose it&#8217;s because I
used to hear how tough actresses were when I was
a kid. And because Cora Boyle made a doormat
of me. Ain&#8217;t it true we never get over the way
we&#8217;re brought up?&mdash;That&#8217;s what Gurdy calls
a platitude, I guess.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Gurdy&#8217;s horridly mature for twenty-one,
Mark.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thunder,&#8221; said Mark, &#8220;He was always grown
up and he&#8217;s knocked around a lot for his age.
Enough to make anybody mature!&mdash;And he&#8217;s in
love with sister up to his neck. You should have
seen him take a runnin&#8217; jump and start for Chicago
the minute he heard she was landing!
Simply hopped the next train and flew! Stayed
out there a month, pretty nearly. Brings his
friends down over Sundays and then sits and
watches them wobble round Margot like a cat
watching a fat mouse. Love&#8217;s awful hard on
these dignified kids, Olive.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You want them married?&#8221; she murmured.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course.&mdash;I know I&#8217;m silly about the kids
but I don&#8217;t see where Margot&#8217;ll get any one much
better. Don&#8217;t start lecturin&#8217; me and say that
there&#8217;s ten million eight hundred thousand
and twenty-two better boys loose around than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
Gurdy. You&#8217;d be talking at a stone wall. Waste
of breath. And he&#8217;s sensible about her too.
A kid in love ordinarily wouldn&#8217;t argue about anything
the way he did about this play of Colonel
Duffords. They had a regular cat fight and
Gurdy&#8217;s right. It&#8217;s a pretty poor show.&mdash;This is
the East river.&#8221;</p>

<p>The car moved diligently through the heat.
Olive thought that Gurdy had belied his outer
calm by his flight to Chicago. But it was hard to
think of anything save the thick air. Mark&#8217;s
tanned face was damp and he fanned Olive steadily.
They swung past a procession of vans where
the drivers lolled in torn undershirts. The rancorous
sun on the houses of unfamiliar shingle
dizzied her. She saw strange trees in the country
as the suburbs thinned and the blistered paint of
billboards showed strange wares for sale.</p>

<p>&#8220;Movie plant over there,&#8221; said Mark, &#8220;Like to
be movied for one of the current event weeklies?
Lady Olive Ilden, the celebrated British authoress?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Horrors! Drinking tea with a Pom in my
lap. Never!&mdash;Good heavens, Mark, is it like this
summer after summer? Why don&#8217;t people
simply go naked?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Margot does her best. If her grandmother
Walling could see her bathsuit she&#8217;d rise from the
tomb.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>&#8220;How long has your mother been dead, old
man?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Since I was eight&mdash;no, nine.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you look like her?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. Joe&mdash;Margot&#8217;s dad&mdash;looked something
like her. His hair was nearly black and he had
brown eyes. She was nice. Used to take her hair
down and let me play with it. Black.&#8221; He
smiled, did not speak for minutes and then talked
of Gurdy again, &#8220;He&#8217;s mighty nice to his father
and mother. Eddie and Sadie are scared he&#8217;ll
marry an actress on account of his bein&#8217; in my
office. Gurdy was teasin&#8217; them last week&mdash;They
came up to do some shopping. Said he&#8217;d got hold
of a yellow headed stomach dancer. Called her
some crazy French name.&mdash;My lord, haven&#8217;t
things changed on the stage since we were kids!
I remember when Ruth Saint Denis was doing her
Hindoo dances first and people were kind of
shocked. I dropped in one afternoon and the
place was packed full of women. Heard this
drawly kind of voice behind me and looked round.
It was Mark Twain and Mr. Howells. Ruth did
a dance without much on and the women all gabbled
like fury. But they all applauded a lot. Mr.
Howells was sort of bored. He said, &#8216;What are
they making that fuss for, Sam?&#8217; &#8216;Oh,&#8217; old
Clemens said, &#8216;they&#8217;re hoping the next dance&#8217;ll
be dirtier so they can feel like Christians.&#8217; My<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
God, he was a wonder to look at!&mdash;Ever think
how much good looks do help a man along?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t think unless you fan me, Mark. My
brain&#8217;s boiling. How many more miles to a
bath?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Twenty.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve always been fond of you,&#8221; said Olive,
&#8220;but I never realized what a brave man you were!
You <i>work</i> in this furnace? Fan me!&#8221;</p>

<p>The cottage stood on a slope of presentable
lawn that ended in a pebbly shore. The motor
rushed through a fir plantation, reached the
Georgian portico and Olive gladly smelled salt
wind rising from the water fading in sunset.</p>

<p>&#8220;There she is,&#8221; said Mark and whistled to a
shape, black and tan against the sound, poised at
the lip of a whitewashed pier. Margot came
running and some men in bathsuits stared,
deserted. The girl raced in a shimmer that reddened
her legs to copper. Olive wondered if anything
so alive, so gay existed elsewhere on this
barbarous shore crushed by summer. Mark saw
them happy, wiped his silly eyes and went down
to chat in guarded grammar with the three young
men from across the shallow bay. Inevitable
that youngsters should come swimming and these
were likeable fellows. Gurdy vouched for them.
They slid soon like piebald seals into the water
and swam off in a flurry of spray and bronze<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
arms. Delicate wakes of fine bubbling spread
on the surface. The wet heads grew small in this
wide space of beryl. Again he watched irreproducible
beauty.... It was right that the best
makers of scenes wouldn&#8217;t paint the sea on back-drops.
Let the people fancy it there below the
vacancy of some open window. He must have
the Cuban seas suggested thus in &#8216;Captain Salvador.&#8217;
He wished that Margot didn&#8217;t dislike the
tragedy. Perhaps its stiff denial of lasting love
afflicted her. It afflicted Mark. And yet the
poet was right. The passion in the play would be
a fleet, hot thing, engrossing for a week, a month
and then stale for ever. Lust went so. He nodded
and picked up Margot&#8217;s black and yellow
bath wrap, a foolish, lovely cape in which she
looked like an Arab. Then she called to him and
he walked back to where she sat on the tiled steps
reading a letter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Olive brought me a note from Doris Arbuthnot.
Lives in Devonshire. She&#8217;s a dear ... rather
like aunt Sadie but not quite so hefty. All
the Wacks have come home from France, now,
and they won&#8217;t work. They sit about and talk to
the heroes about France. Doris owns gobs of
land and she&#8217;s having a poky time.&mdash;What are
you laughing at?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your hair, sister.&#8221;</p>

<p>She passed her hands over the sponge of black<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
down and shrugged, &#8220;Sorry I had it bobbed.
All the typists do, over here. Olive&#8217;s frightfully
done up. Gone to bathe.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Glad to have her, ain&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ra&mdash;ther!&mdash;Oh, Cosmo Rand called up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What the&mdash;deuce did he want?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ronny Dufford gave him a heap of notes
about &#8216;Todgers Intrudes.&#8217; I told him he&#8217;d best
leave them at your office.&mdash;Shall you start rehearsing
&#8216;Todgers&#8217; as soon as the strike&#8217;s over?&#8221;</p>

<p>She sneezed, the efflorescence of her hair flapping.
Mark tossed the wrap about her, kissed
her ear and sat down on the steps. He said,
&#8220;Don&#8217;t know, daughter. Fact is, this piece of
Dufford&#8217;s hasn&#8217;t played to big business in London.
I&#8217;ve got a report on it. Gurdy don&#8217;t think&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Gurdy! He simply can&#8217;t like a play unless
it&#8217;s about the long suffering proletariat or
Russia!&mdash;Why didn&#8217;t he come down?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Got a party with some men.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And I wanted the brute to show me putting
tomorrow! D&#8217;you put well? Of course you do!&mdash;Oh,
I know &#8216;Todgers&#8217; isn&#8217;t a new Man and
Superman, of course. But it&#8217;s witty and it isn&#8217;t
commonplace&mdash;don&#8217;t laugh.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mark marshalled words, lighting a cigarette.
&#8220;Honey, that&#8217;s just the trouble with the thing.
It is commonplace. It&#8217;s all about nothing. And
it&#8217;s too blamed English. You and Gurd seem to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
think it&#8217;s the bounden duty of every one to know
all the latest English slang off Piccadilly&mdash;or
wherever they make slang up. It ain&#8217;t so. We&#8217;ll
have to have some of this piece translated as it is.
Suppose you were a stenographer going to the
play? You wouldn&#8217;t have been abroad. You
wouldn&#8217;t know an Earl beats a Baron. You
wouldn&#8217;t know that Chelsea&#8217;s a big sister to
Greenwich village and the slang&#8217;d bore you to
death. There&#8217;s that three speech joke about
Gippies and Chokers in the second act. I expect
that raised a laugh in London. How many folks
in the house here would know it meant cigarettes?
I didn&#8217;t till you told me. Now in London with
Ealy playing the Earl&mdash;he did, didn&#8217;t he?&mdash;Well,
with a smart man like that to play the Earl, the
thing might go pretty well. If I had some one
like that&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Margot yawned, &#8220;Why not try Cosmo Rand?
He played the Earl in London while Ealy was
having the flu and had very good notices. He
was awfully good in the scene where he rows with
his wife. The poor devil&#8217;s had a good deal of
practice, they say. Cora Boyle leads him a dog&#8217;s
life. Ronny Dufford tells me that she&#8217;s horribly
jealous. Mr. Rand&#8217;s had a success on his own,
you know? He&#8217;s not her leading man any more.&mdash;She
doesn&#8217;t like his getting ahead of her.&mdash;Now
what are you laughing at?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>&#8220;The leopard don&#8217;t change her spots,&#8221; said
Mark.</p>

<p>&#8220;Poor dad!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, well,&#8221; he said in a luxury of amusement,
&#8220;She wasn&#8217;t raised right. Her folks were circus
people. I guess you couldn&#8217;t imagine how tough
the old style circus people were if you worked all
night at it. This Rand&#8217;s a nice fellow, is he?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very pleasant. He rehearsed a lot of us in a
show and we were all rather rotten and he was
very patient.&mdash;I do wish Gurdy had come down!&mdash;We
shan&#8217;t have four for bridge. Might have
Olive&#8217;s maid play. She&#8217;s dreadfully grand, you
know? She&#8217;s the Presidentess of the Chelsea
Lady Helpers Association. Used to be in the
scullery at Windsor and Queen Alexandra spoke
to her once. I&#8217;m rather afraid of her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is there any one you are afraid of, sister?&#8221;</p>

<p>She rose, the yellow and black gown moulding
in, and gave her muffled, slow chuckle, patting the
step with a sole. &#8220;Don&#8217;t know. Gurdy, when
he&#8217;s grouchy. I must go dress.&mdash;Oh, I had
whitewine cup made for dinner. That&#8217;s what
you like when it&#8217;s hot, isn&#8217;t it? Do put on a
white suit for dinner, dad. Makes your hair so
red. God be with you till we meet again.&#8221;</p>

<p>She wandered over the white and red tiles of
the portico, leaving a trail of damp, iridescent
prints in the last glitter of the sun. She hummed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
some air he did not know and this hung in his ear
like the pulse of a muted violin when she herself
was gone. The man sat dreaming until the night
about him was dull blue and the wind died. He
sat in warm felicity, guarding the silent house
until the rose spark of the light across the bay
began to turn and a silver, mighty star flared high
on the darker blue of heaven.</p>

Cosmo Rand</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">ON Saturday Gurdy brought down three
young men who hadn&#8217;t met Margot.
He busily noted the chemistry of passion
as two of his friends became maniacal by Sunday
morning. Against the worn composure of Lady
Ilden, the girl had the value of a gem on dim
velvet. The third young man wanted to talk
Irish politics to the Englishwoman who evaded
him and retired to write a letter in her bedroom
above the lawn.</p>

<p>She wrote to her husband at Malta: &#8220;I had
always thought that Margot&#8217;s success in London
was due to her exotic quality. But she seems
quite as successful on her native heath. This
leads me to the general platitude that boys are the
same the world over. I am a success here, too.
Many callers, mostly female, in huge motor cars.
The American woman seems to consider frocks a
substitute for manners and conversation. Mark
is anxious that Margot should marry Gurdy Bernamer
and Gurdy is plainly willing. It would
be suitable enough. The boy has smart friends<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
and will inherit £10,000 from old Mr. Carlson.
Margot can float herself in local society no
doubt. She is now playing tennis with two young
brokers and a 22 year old journalist whose father
owns half of some State. I have mailed you a
strange work, &#8216;Jurgen&#8217; by some unheard of
person. Do not let any of the more moral midshipmen
read it.&#8221; She stopped, seeing Gurdy
saunter across the lawn toward the beach and pursued
him to where he curled on the sand. &#8220;You
frighten me,&#8221; she said, taking her eyes from the
scar that showed its upper reach above his
bathshirt, &#8220;you lie about two thirds naked in
this sun and then tell me it&#8217;s a cool day.&mdash;But I
want to be documented in American fiction.
I&#8217;ve read five novels since Wednesday. It seems
to be established that all your millionaires are
conscious villains and all your poor are martyrs
except a select group known as gangsters. That&#8217;s
thrilling when the reviewers so loudly insist that
your authors flatter the rich.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Some of them do,&#8221; Gurdy said, lifting his
legs in the hot air.</p>

<p>In a bathsuit he lost his civilized seeming, was
heroic, sprawled on the sand. Olive told him:
&#8220;You&#8217;re one of those victims of modernity, old
son. You belong to thirteen forty. Green
tights and a dark tunic trimmed with white fur.
Legs are legs, aren&#8217;t they?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>&#8220;Heredity&#8217;s funny,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I look exactly
like my father.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Margot&#8217;s Uncle Eddie? She talks of him a
good deal and of your mother. I was rather
afraid her metropolitan airs and graces would
shock your people but she seems to have had a
jolly time down there&mdash;New Jersey&#8217;s down from
here, isn&#8217;t it? She enjoyed herself.&mdash;Metropolitan
airs and graces!&mdash;That&#8217;s a quotation from
something. Sounds like the <i>Manchester Guardian</i>.&mdash;Should
I like your people?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You might. Grandfather&#8217;s an atheist.
Dad&#8217;s a good deal of a cynic. They&#8217;re awfully
nice small town people. My sisters all wish they
were movie stars and my kid brothers think that
a fighting marine is the greatest work of God.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And Margot says they all think you&#8217;re the
last and best incarnation of Siegfried. I should
like to see them.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gurdy shuddered. Grandfather Walling and
Mrs. Bernamer held Lady Ilden responsible for
the ruin of Margot as a relative. He imagined
her artifice and her ease faced by the horrified
family&mdash;a group of frightened colts stumbling
off from a strange farmhand. He poured sand
over his arm and lied, &#8220;You&#8217;d scare them.
Mark&#8217;s always talked about you as though you
were the Encyclopædia Brittanica on two legs.
You might be interested, though.&mdash;I say, Mark&#8217;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
decided that he will produce &#8216;Todgers Intrudes.&#8217;
Thinks he&#8217;ll have Cosmo Rand play the Earl.
Can Rand really act?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh,&mdash;well enough for that sort of tosh.
He&#8217;s handsome and he has a pleasant voice.
But it&#8217;s rather silly of Mark to force such a poor
play on the public because Margot wants Ronny
Dufford out of debt. But he&#8217;s so intoxicated
with Margot just now that he&#8217;d do murders for
her. Why didn&#8217;t he come down for the week-end?&#8221;</p>

<p>Gurdy got up and yawned, &#8220;Oh, his treasurer&#8217;s
wife ran off with a man last Wednesday&mdash;while
he was down here. He&#8217;s trying to patch it up.&mdash;You
know, he isn&#8217;t at all cynical, Lady Ilden.
He&#8217;s very easily upset by things like that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose he likes his treasurer? Then why
shouldn&#8217;t he be upset? The treasurer can&#8217;t be enjoying
the affair.&mdash;I wonder if you appreciate
Mark&#8217;s noble strain, Gurdy? I think I must
send you a copy of the letter he wrote me after
he&#8217;d packed you off to school. I showed it to my
husband who has all the susceptibility of the
Nelson monument and he almost shed tears. It
took something more than mere snobbery or a desire
for your future gratitude to make Mark send
you away. It horribly hurt him. If paternal
affection&#8217;s a disease the man&#8217;s a walking hospital!&mdash;There&#8217;s
the luncheon bell.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>Gurdy ran into the water and furiously swam.
Unless Lady Ilden was making amiable phrases
Margot had lied to her about the family at
Fayettesville. It was natural that she should
tell Mark how she&#8217;d enjoyed the farm. That
was prudent kindness, no worse than his own
gratitudes when Mark gave him sapphire scarf-pins
and fresh silver cigarette cases that he didn&#8217;t
need or want. But Margot shouldn&#8217;t lie to Lady
Ilden. Gurdy avoided the next week-end and
went to Fayettesville where his family worried
because Mark was losing money through the
actors&#8217; strike.</p>

<p>&#8220;And he&#8217;ll need all he can lay hands on with
Margot to look after,&#8221; said Mrs. Bernamer,
rocking her weight in a chair on the veranda,
&#8220;It ain&#8217;t sensible for him to&mdash;to bow down and
worship that child like he does. Oh, she&#8217;s
pretty enough!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Get out,&#8221; Bernamer commented, &#8220;He&#8217;d be
foolish about her if she&#8217;d got to wear spectacles
and was bowlegged. Gimme a cigarette, Gurd.
How near&#8217;s the Walling finished?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Two thirds, Dad.&mdash;Grandfather, you&#8217;ll have
to come up and sit in a box the opening night.&#8221;</p>

<p>The beautiful old man blinked and drawled,
&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t go up to N&#8217;York to see Daniel
Bandmann play &#8216;Hamlet&#8217;&mdash;if he was alive.
How&#8217;s old Mr. Carlson get on?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>Gurdy often found the contrast between his
grandfather and Carlson diverting. The dying
manager, a cynic, wanted Heaven in all the decorations
of the Apocalypse. The old peasant
lazily insisted that death would end him. He got
some hidden pleasure from the thought of utter
passage. Gurdy found this content stupendous.
The farmer had never been two hundred miles
from his dull acreage and yet was ready to be
done with his known universe while Carlson
wanted eternity. He cackled when the striking
actors made peace and ordered wreaths sent to
the more stubborn managers. His bitter tongue
rattled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t more writers write for the theatre,
Gurdy? Ever been in Billy Loeffler&#8217;s office?
Five thousand bootlickers and hussies squatted
all over the place. I sent that fellow Moody that
wrote the &#8216;Great Divide&#8217; to see Loeffler. Had to
set in the office with a bunch of song carpenters
from tin pan alley and a couple of tarts while
Loeffler was prob&#8217;ly talkin&#8217; to some old souse
he&#8217;d knew in Salt Lake City. And then Loeffler
looks at the play and asks is there a soobrette part
in it for some tomtit his brother was keepin&#8217;! A
writer&#8217;s got a thin skin, ain&#8217;t he? Here Mark
gets mad because this writer Mencken says
managers are a bunch of hogs. Well, ain&#8217;t they?
Four or five ain&#8217;t. Sure, they&#8217;re hogs. Human<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
beings. Hogs. Same as the rest of mankind.
Good thing Christ died to save us.&#8221; He contemplated
redemption through the cigarette smoke.
His Irish nurse crossed herself in a corner.
Carlson went on, &#8220;Say, that feller Russell Mark&#8217;s
got drillin&#8217; that English comedy is all right.
Was in to see me, yesterday. Good head.
Knows his job. Says this Rand pinhead is raisin&#8217;
Cain at rehearsals. Better drop in there and see
what goes on. Mark&#8217;s so busy with that Cuban
play he ain&#8217;t got time.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rehearsals of &#8220;Todgers Intrudes&#8221; went on at a
small theatre below Forty Second Street. Gurdy
drifted into the warm place and watched the
director, Russell, working. On the bare stage
five people progressed from point to point of the
tepid comedy. Russell, a stooped, bald man of
thirty-five, sat near the orchestra pit. Gurdy had
watched the rehearsal ten minutes before Russell
spoke. &#8220;Don&#8217;t cross, there, Miss Marryatt.
Stand still.&#8221; Then, &#8220;still, please, Mr. Rand.&#8221;
On the stage Cosmo Rand gave the director a
stare, shrugged and strolled toward the cockney
comedian, the intrusive Todgers of the plot.
Russell said nothing until a long speech finished,
then, &#8220;You&#8217;re all rushing about like cooties. Go
back to Miss Marryatt&#8217;s entrance and take all
your lines just as you stand after she&#8217;s sat down.
Dora isn&#8217;t pronounced Durrer, Mr. Hughes.&#8221;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
Gurdy was thinking of the long patience needed
in this trade when Russell spoke sharply, &#8220;Mr.
Rand, will you please stand still!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My God,&#8221; said Rand, &#8220;must I keep telling you
that I played this part in&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you be so good as to stand still?&#8221;</p>

<p>Rand continued his lines. Gurdy walked down
and slipped into a chair beside the director, aware
that the players stiffened as soon as they saw
Mark&#8217;s nephew. The handsome Miss Marryatt
began to act. Cosmo Rand sent out his speeches
with a pleasant briskness. Russell murmured,
&#8220;Glad you happened in, Bernamer. This was
getting beyond me. School children,&#8221; and the
act ended.</p>

<p>&#8220;Three o&#8217;clock, please,&#8221; said the director.
The small company trickled out of the theatre.
Russell lit his pipe and stretched, grinning.
&#8220;Rand&#8217;s very capable and a nice fellow enough
but he&#8217;s difficult. Fine looking, isn&#8217;t he? Come
to lunch with me.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was startling to be taken into an engineer&#8217;s
club for the meal. Russell explained, &#8220;I was an
engineer. It&#8217;s not so different from stage directing.
You sometimes get very much the same
material. I&#8217;ve often wanted some dynamite or a
pickax at rehearsals. Nice that you floated in
just now. I&#8217;ve a curiosity about this piece.
Does Mr. Walling see money in it? I don&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>&#8220;He thinks it may go,&#8221; said Gurdy.</p>

<p>&#8220;It won&#8217;t. It&#8217;s sewed up in a crape. If you
had a young John Drew and a couple of raving
beauties playing it might run six weeks. And
Dufford hasn&#8217;t any standing among the cerebrals.
We might try to brighten the thing with some
references to the Nourritures Terrestres or
Freud. It&#8217;s a moron. Prenatal influence. Mr.
Walling tells me we&#8217;re to open in Washington,
too. My jinx! I went down there to offer up
my life for the country and got stuck in the
Q.M.C. supervising crates of tomatoes. Did
you ever argue with a wholesale grocer about
crates? It&#8217;s worse than staging a revue.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a dreadful thing to say!&#8221;</p>

<p>Russell broke a roll in his pointed fingers and
shook his head. &#8220;No.... The revue&#8217;s a very
high form of comedy when it&#8217;s handled right.
It gets clean away with common sense, for one
thing. And it hasn&#8217;t a plot. I hate plots unless
they&#8217;re good plots. That&#8217;s why this miserable
&#8216;Todgers&#8217; thing affects me so badly. I hoped Mr.
Walling would let me help him with &#8216;Captain
Salvador.&#8217; But it&#8217;s his baby.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is Rand giving you as much trouble as that
every day?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Trouble? My dear man, you&#8217;ve never rehearsed
a woman star who had ideas about her
art! Rand&#8217;s merely rather annoying, not troublesome.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
He&#8217;s got no brains so his idea is to imitate
the man who played the part in London. And
he&#8217;s never learned how to show all his looks,
either. But very few Americans know how.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gurdy liked the director and spent several
afternoons at the rehearsals. Cosmo Rand fretted
him. The slight man was obdurate. He
raced about the stage until Russell checked him.
His legs, sheathed always in grey tweed, seemed
fluid. The leading woman had an attack of tonsilitis
and halted proceedings. It was during this
lapse that Gurdy encountered Cosmo Rand in a
hotel lounge and nodded. The actor stopped
him, deferentially, &#8220;I say, I&#8217;m afraid poor
Russell&#8217;s sick to death of me. I&#8217;m giving him a
bit of trouble.&#8221; Gurdy found no answer. The
actor fooled with his grey hat, rubbed his vivid
nails on a cuff, corrected his moustache and said,
&#8220;The fact is&mdash;I do most sincerely think that
Russell&#8217;s wrong to drop all the English stage
directions. Couldn&#8217;t you&mdash;suggest that Mr.
Walling drop in to watch sometime when Miss
Marryatt&#8217;s better and we&#8217;re rehearsing again?&#8221;</p>

<p>His soft, round bronze eyes were anxious. He
spoke timidly, the rosy fingernails in a row on his
lower lip. He was something frail and graceful,
a figure from a journal of fashions. Gurdy
wondered whether Cora Boyle ever assaulted her
poor mate and smiled.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>&#8220;Mr. Walling has a good deal of confidence in
Russell&#8217;s judgment, Mr. Rand. But I&#8217;ll speak
to him if you like.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d be most awf&#8217;ly grateful if you would, Mr.
Bernamer. The play&#8217;s such a jolly thing and one
would like to see it do well. Ronny Dufford&#8217;s
rather a dear friend and&mdash;so very broke, you
know?&#8221;</p>

<p>The rosy, trim creature seemed truly worried.
Meeting Russell at the 45th Street office the next
day, Gurdy told him that Rand&#8217;s heart was breaking.
The director grimaced, patting his bald
forehead.</p>

<p>&#8220;The little tyke&#8217;s worrying for fear he won&#8217;t
get good notices. And if this rubbish should
fluke into a success he&#8217;ll be made into a star.
Have you ever observed the passion of the American
public for second rate acting? Especially if
it happens to have a slight foreign accent? Modjeska,
Bandmann, Nazimova?&mdash;Well, Miss Marryatt&#8217;s
all right again. We&#8217;ll rehearse some more
tomorrow. Come and look on.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mark had gone to Fayettesville for a few days.
Gurdy attended the morning rehearsal of &#8220;Todgers
Intrudes.&#8221; Cosmo Rand trotted about the
stage determinedly and Russell turned on Gurdy
with a groan of, &#8220;This is beyond me. I&#8217;m getting
ready to do murder. He&#8217;s throwing the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
whole thing out of key. I shall have to get your
uncle to squash him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m beginning to see why Mr. Carlson loathes
actors so,&#8221; Gurdy whispered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Holy Moses,&#8221; the director mourned,
&#8220;look at him!&mdash;Slower, please, Mr. Rand!&mdash;It&#8217;ll
be awkward if I get Mr. Walling to squash him,
Bernamer. You never can tell how these walking
egoisms will break out. He may run about town
saying that Mr. Walling&#8217;s oppressing him cruelly.&mdash;My
God, he&#8217;ll be crawling up the scene in a minute!&#8221;</p>

<p>On the stage, Rand had excited himself to a
circular movement about a large divan in the
centre. He had somehow the look of a single
racer coming home ahead of the other runners.
The men and women standing still suggested a
sparse audience for this athletic feat. It was
ludicrous. Worse, Mark would never scold Cora
Boyle&#8217;s husband. Gurdy took a resolve. Margot
had made Mark waste time with this silly
play. She had proposed Rand for the part. She
should help. He hurried to the station and
reached the cottage in mid afternoon. A warm
October wind made the fir trees whistle. He
found Margot in a silk sweater of dull rose putting
a tennis ball about the dry lawn. She
smiled, tilting the golfstick across a shoulder,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
and swayed her slim body back to look up at
Gurdy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dad just telephoned from the farm, old son.
Wanted to know if you were here. It was something
about &#8216;Captain Salvador&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes. I was hunting a tom tom for the
Voodoo scene. He doesn&#8217;t like the one they&#8217;re
using. Doesn&#8217;t thud loudly enough.&mdash;Can I talk
to you about &#8216;Todgers Intrudes&#8217; without having
a fight?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course you can.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right. It&#8217;s going very badly. Mr.
Russell, the director, has a free for all row with
Mr. Rand every day. Rand acts like the last of
a ballet. He&#8217;s putting everything back. He&#8217;s
out of the picture all the time. Word of honour,
Margot, the play hasn&#8217;t nine lives. It&#8217;s thin.
It&#8217;ll take a lot of work to make it go. Russell&#8217;s
one of the best directors going and he knows what
he&#8217;s doing. Rand simply runs all over the stage
like that clown at the Hippodrome.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s rather the way it was played in London.
Of course, that&#8217;s no excuse. Have dad
scold Rand.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Be pretty awkward for Mark&mdash;scolding Cora
Boyle&#8217;s husband.&#8221;</p>

<p>Margot said, &#8220;What utter tosh!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, it&#8217;s not. Mark&#8217;s old fashioned&mdash;sensitive
about things like that. And Rand might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
take it as spite. Cora Boyle&#8217;s back from California,
Russell tells me. She&#8217;s a fearful liar.
If she hears that Mark jumped on her husband
she&#8217;ll tell all her friends that Mark&#8217;s simply a
swine. You don&#8217;t know how gossip travels and
gets&mdash;distorted. Once last May Mark said that
he didn&#8217;t like a gown that some woman was wearing
in a play we&#8217;d been to the night before. He
said that at lunch in the Claridge. Next day
the woman&#8217;s husband came into the office and
wanted to thrash Mark. By the time the story
got to him it had swelled up like a balloon. This
fellow had got it that Mark said his wife looked
like a streetwalker and acted like one.&mdash;It&#8217;s all
very awkward. Couldn&#8217;t you&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, look here! Because I suggested Cossy
Rand for the Earl I&#8217;m not going to drynurse him!&mdash;I
think you&#8217;re frightfully hypersensitive about
his being married to Cora Boyle. They&#8217;re hardly
ever together. It&#8217;s taking a theatrical menage
as seriously as&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, for heaven&#8217;s sake,&#8221; Gurdy broke in,
watching the red streaks mount her face, &#8220;I&#8217;m
sorry! Let&#8217;s drop it. You know Rand. I
thought you might write him a line and tell him
to calm down. That was all. Mark&#8217;s working
himself sick over &#8216;Captain Salvador&#8217; and that&#8217;s
an important production. Every one&#8217;s interested
in it. Some of the critics have read it and think<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
it&#8217;s the best American play in years. After all,
you got Mark into this &#8216;Todgers&#8217; thing. He&#8217;s doing
it to please you. He&#8217;ll worry if he has to&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Margot laughed, whipped the ball away neatly
with one foot and tossed her hair back. She
said, &#8220;I&#8217;ll write Rand, of course. Of course I
don&#8217;t want &#8216;Todgers&#8217; to get a black eye. I&#8217;ll
send him a note and tell him to carry on. Perhaps
he&#8217;s rather opinionated. Where&#8217;s he stopping?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Knickerbocker.&#8221;</p>

<p>She yawned, &#8220;I&#8217;ll write him, then. Staying
for dinner?&#8221; She turned and roamed off in her
swaying fashion. Directly, a motor swung about
the house. One of the neighbours had come to
take the girl driving. She waved to Gurdy and
disappeared. He resented the waving of the
brown hand. It was impossible not to resent her
kind mentions of his mother and sisters before
Lady Ilden and Mark.</p>

<p>He resented, too, the airy changes from tart
rage to suavity. Their talks became a tedious,
uncertain duet with one performer unwilling.
Gurdy strolled into the cottage and Olive Ilden
looked up from a novel.</p>

<p>&#8220;What have you been quarrelling with Margot
about?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not quarrelling.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nonsense. I could see you through the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
doors. You were quarrelling and she began it.
Tell me.&#8221;</p>

<p>She closed the book and regarded him, not
smiling, from her wicker chair. There was an
odd alarm in her eyes under which hollows
showed. The negligent trail of her black gown
was dusted with cigarette ash. Gurdy stared,
upset.</p>

<p>&#8220;We weren&#8217;t quarrelling. Cosmo Rand&#8217;s making
an ass of himself at the rehearsals. She
rather planted him on Mark. Mark&#8217;s so sensitive
about Cora Boyle that Russell&mdash;the man
who&#8217;s rehearsing &#8216;Todgers&#8217;&mdash;and I don&#8217;t want
to worry Mark with the mess. I wanted Margot
to write Rand a note and tell him to buck up.
He&#8217;s holding the rehearsals back. Here it&#8217;s
almost the first of November. Mark&#8217;s got a
theatre in Washington for a couple of weeks from
now and the play isn&#8217;t half ready.&#8221;</p>

<p>Olive tapped a cigarette holder on the walnut,
Dutch table and looked at the floor. Then she
raised her eyes and smiled, spoke without artifice.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shan&#8217;t let her write to Rand, Gurdy. She&#8217;s
too much interested in him. I don&#8217;t like it. She
cabled him to come over here as soon as she&#8217;d
bullied Mark into buying the rights to &#8216;Todgers
Intrudes.&#8217; The little idiot thinks him a great
actor. I&#8217;m sure I don&#8217;t know why. I don&#8217;t at
all like this. I only found it out yesterday.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
Mark wouldn&#8217;t like it. The man&#8217;s married and
if he happens to tell people Margot sent for him&mdash;I
quite understand theatrical gossip, Gurdy.
Mark&#8217;s a great person and it would make quite a
story. And of course there are rats who don&#8217;t
like Mark.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How did you find this out, Lady&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In the silliest way. I was talking about
Ronny Dufford and Margot began to argue that
this wretched play is really good. She rather
lost her temper. She told me you&#8217;d tried to persuade
Mark not to produce the thing to spite her.
I&mdash;&#8221; Olive laughed unhappily, &#8220;I hadn&#8217;t the
faintest idea that you&#8217;d quarrelled. You&#8217;re
rather too cool, old man. I&#8217;ve been teasing you
all this time fancying that you were wildly in love
with the child and it seems that you&#8217;re at odds.&mdash;Oh,
It&#8217;s all utter nonsense, of course! But I
don&#8217;t like it. It&#8217;s a pose. She rather prides herself
on being unconventional. And the silliest
part of it is that she feels she&#8217;s done Mark a
favour.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s probably cost him about fifteen thousand
dollars,&#8221; said Gurdy.</p>

<p>This was antique, this tale of a handsome,
dapper actor and a girl gone moonstruck over his
pink face. Gurdy grunted, &#8220;We can&#8217;t tell Mark
this. He&#8217;d be upset. It&#8217;s idiotic.&#8221;</p>

<p>Olive laughed, &#8220;Oh, you mustn&#8217;t get excited<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
over it, Gurdy. The play will fail and she&#8217;ll
drop Rand. It&#8217;s a gesture, you see? The clever
girl doing the unconventional thing.&#8221; She became
comfortable, then artificial. &#8220;You mustn&#8217;t take
Margot at her own valuation, dear. She&#8217;s the
moment&mdash;the melodramatic moment. What&#8217;s
that American slang? She&#8217;s no&mdash;no ball of fire!
She admires people easily and drops them easily.
She&#8217;s eighteen. She was quite lost in adoration
of the Countess of Flint two years ago and then
the poor woman did something the child didn&#8217;t
like&mdash;wore the wrong frock, probably&mdash;and that
was all over. The poor lady died in Colorado
yesterday.&mdash;That means consumption, doesn&#8217;t it?
I read the notice to Margot at breakfast and she
said, &#8216;Really.&#8217; Rand flattered her about her acting,
I fancy, and she thinks he&#8217;s remarkable in
return for the compliment. Every normal female
gets mushy&mdash;I&#8217;m quite Americanized&mdash;over
an actor at eighteen. When I was eighteen I
wrote a five act tragedy and sent it to&mdash;Merciful
Heaven&mdash;I&#8217;ve forgotten who he was! Beerbohm
Tree, probably. But I must congratulate you on
your attitude. You had a frightful row at Fayettesville.
She said, herself, that she was to
blame. She hurt you. And you&#8217;ve not shown it
in the least.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It didn&#8217;t amount to much.&mdash;But, Mark
wouldn&#8217;t like this business. And of course some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
people don&#8217;t like him. They&#8217;d be ready to talk
if they thought she was flirting with&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But she isn&#8217;t! If she was I&#8217;d drag her off to
Japan with me. She&#8217;s hardly spoken to the man
except at those rehearsals last winter. It&#8217;ll die
a swift death when the play fails, old man.
We&#8217;ve no use for failures at eighteen.&#8221;</p>

<p>Olive laughed, repeated the prophecy in a
dozen turning phrases and drove with Gurdy to
the station after dinner. But she was oppressed.
She could imagine Mark&#8217;s bewilderment clearly.
He found Rand a somewhat comic person, a frail
young poser towed after the robust beauty of his
wife, perhaps bullied. The car brought Olive
back to the white portico of the cottage and she
found Margot distracting a middle aged sugar
broker. It was time for bed when the addled
man&#8217;s car puffed away. Margot yawned and
mounted the brown stairs in a flutter of marigold
skirts. The living-room fell still. Olive settled
at a table and commenced a letter to Ilden. &#8220;I
shall not start for Japan for some time. Margot
is behaving rather queerly. Having fancied
that I could follow the eccentric curves of her
mind I am much annoyed to find that I can not.
This cottage will be closed next week. Heaven
knows what will become of the furniture unless
Mark should use it in a play. I have a curiosity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
to see the opening of his new theatre. He is
working frantically over the play for its opening.
Gurdy Bernamer tells me that a New York first
night is like nothing else on earth for bounderishness.
He says that awful and obscene creatures
come creeping from nowhere and flap about in
free seats and that all the cinema queens appear
covered with rubies. It&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>The telephone on the table clicked but did not
ring. Olive glared at the instrument. She
abominated the telephone since it had brought
her news of her son&#8217;s death. She finished her
letter and climbed the stairs, aching for bed after
a nervous day. Then she heard Margot talking
behind the closed door of her room. The girl
hadn&#8217;t a maid. Olive&#8217;s own maid was visible in
her chamber at the end of the corridor. Olive
passed on. She came back on impulse and heard
&#8220;All right, Cossy. Carry on. &#8217;By&mdash;ee.&#8221; Then
the small clatter of Margot&#8217;s bedside telephone
set on the glass of a table. Olive opened the
door and saw the girl subsiding into the mass of
her pillows.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve just blown Cosmo Rand up properly,
Olive.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wondered why you were talking.&#8221;</p>

<p>Margot yawned, &#8220;Gurdy asked me to write
him. I&#8217;d rather talk. His dear wife&#8217;s back<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
from California and his voice sounded as though
they&#8217;d been throwing supper dishes at each other.
He didn&#8217;t seem pleased.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear, I don&#8217;t see why Mr. Rand should
be pleased to be lectured on his art over the telephone
at midnight!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s rather cheeky, isn&#8217;t it? But Gurdy made
such a point of it. And all I could say was that
he mustn&#8217;t be too difficult at rehearsals. But
that&#8217;s all I could have said in a note. It seems to
me that it&#8217;s distinctly dad&#8217;s business. But
Gurdy&#8217;s such an everlasting old woman about
dad! And I am rather responsible for bringing
&#8216;Todgers&#8217; over. Dare say I ought to help out, if
I can.&#8221;</p>

<p>Olive slung a dart carelessly, asking, &#8220;What&#8217;s
Rand&#8217;s real name, dear?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Rand.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I meant the Cosmo. That&#8217;s not an American
name at all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t know, I&#8217;m sure. I don&#8217;t like it, anyhow.
But it might be his own. He&#8217;s from some
town in Iowa and they name children fearful
things like Eliander and Jerusha, out there.&#8221;
She chuckled, slipping a tawny shoulder in and out
of her robe. Her face rippled, &#8220;I really think
Cosmo&#8217;s a rather ghastly name. Sounds like a
patent soup. Wonder why they named dad
Mark? Gurdy&#8217;s real name&#8217;s George.&#8221; She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
yawned, &#8220;I suppose all actors get rather opinionated.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As they&#8217;re mostly rank egotists,&#8221; said Olive
and closed the door.</p>

<p>Perplexity remained in her strongly wrestling
with the desire for sleep. She lay composing a
letter to Cosmo Rand&mdash;&#8220;As your position toward
Mr. Walling is delicate and you are under obligations
to Miss Walling may I suggest that you
maintain a purely formal relation toward&mdash;&#8221; It
wouldn&#8217;t do. Words to a shadow. She knew
nothing of the man. He was a graceful figure at
parties in London, considerably hunted by smart
women for Sunday night dinners before the war.
If the comedy failed and Mark dismissed him
Rand might make an ill-tempered use of such a
letter. Olive shrugged off the idea lay wondering
why a pleasant voice and a head of curly hair
seen across footlights should convince Margot
that here was a great actor. It was disappointing.
Olive had thought Margot steeled against
crazes. The girl had a general appreciation of
the arts as seen about London. Olive faintly
sighed. But the pleasing man might embody
some fancy or other, fulfil some buried wish. We
go groping and stumbling among fancies, the
woman thought, and see nothing very clearly.
She consoled herself with the platitude and went
to sleep.</p>

Bubble</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">&#8220;TODGERS INTRUDES&#8221; now went
smoothly. Mark came to one of the
last rehearsals, approved Russell&#8217;s
method but, as they walked up Broadway, told
Gurdy that this was a &#8220;lousy&#8221; play. All plays
were just then nonsense beside &#8220;Captain Salvador.&#8221;
Mark&#8217;s absorption seemed to exclude even
Margot of whom the idolator once gently complained.
The dark goddess had returned to
town, been a week at the Fifty Fifth Street house
and was sitting with Olive at the rear of the 45th
Street Theatre. Her voice reached Mark clearly
where he stood assembling the picture for a scene,
a leg swung over the rail of the orchestra pit.</p>

<p>&#8220;She don&#8217;t seem so much interested in &#8216;Salvador,&#8217;
Gurd. Why&#8217;s that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Rather heavy for her, perhaps.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mark rubbed his nose and accepted wisdom.
A girl of eighteen mightn&#8217;t care for this tale of
shipwrecked ruffians, frantic negroes, moonlit
death. And what innocent girl of eighteen could
know or believe that men got tired of women?
Gurdy understood and was helpful, had found a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
wailing negro song for the shipboard scene of the
first act. Mark beamed at Gurdy, then turned to
the stage and patiently corrected the six negro
actors timid among the white folk of the big company,
pathetic in sapphire and sage green suits.</p>

<p>&#8220;You boys in a circle &#8217;round the table, left.
Keep looking at Mr. Leslie.&#8221;</p>

<p>He picked spots for the grouping. His brown
fingers pointed. He named attitudes, dropping
his lids as he built the picture with glances at the
water colour sketch in his hand. An intricate
chatter began on the stage. Gurdy slipped up
the aisle and joined Olive under the balcony.</p>

<p>&#8220;How careful he is,&#8221; she whispered, &#8220;like
a ballet master.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gurdy nodded, &#8220;No one&#8217;ll move without being
told to. The whole thing&#8217;s planned. He&#8217;s going
to run the lights himself in Boston, next Monday.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll go up there with him? He looks
dreadfully thin.&#8221; His black height made a centre
against the footlights. His mastery of this
human paint was impressive, admirable. He
visibly laboured, silent, listening. She asked,
&#8220;Would he work as hard over an ordinary, commercial
play?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. Oh, he&#8217;d work hard but not as hard as
this.&#8221;</p>

<p>Margot glanced across Olive, then at her watch.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
She said, &#8220;Let&#8217;s clear out, Olive. Teatime.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d much rather stay here. Fascinating.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you told Mrs. Marlett Smith you&#8217;d
come.&#8221;</p>

<p>Olive sighed and gathered her furs. It was
important that Margot should go to this tea at
the Marlett Smith house. Mrs. Marlett Smith
was a liberal, amusing woman who had met
Mark by way of some playwright and had called
on Olive at the seaside cottage. They left the
theatre and Gurdy came to open the door of the
blue car. To him Margot suddenly spoke,
&#8220;How will dad open this silly thing in Boston,
Monday night and get to Washington by Tuesday
night to open &#8216;Todgers&#8217;?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll be there,&#8221; he said and closed the door.</p>

<p>Olive looked back at his colourless dress, his
shapely head and vanishing grave face with a
frank wistfulness. &#8220;I don&#8217;t see why you should
make such a point of annoying Gurdy. And why
call this play silly when it&#8217;s so plainly good?...
I&#8217;ve carefully refrained from asking you why you
quarrelled with Gurdy. He behaves charmingly
to you and keeps the peace.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Paying him back for being nasty about &#8216;Todgers
Intrudes.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But he&#8217;s not been nasty. He&#8217;s very sensibly
given his opinion that it&#8217;s feeble. As it is.&mdash;The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
man&#8217;s taking us down Broadway. Loathsome
sewer!&#8221;</p>

<p>The motor slowly passed toward Forty Second
Street and across that jam. Olive saw lean and
stolid Englishmen stalking in the harsh, dusty
November wind that blew women along in the
whirling similitude of rotted flowers. Margot
got notice, here. There was a jerk of male heads
from the curb. Empty faces turned to the girl&#8217;s
brilliance in rose cloth. A tanned sailor flapped
his white cap. Yet in the Marlett Smith library
on Park Avenue Margot was prettily discreet for
half an hour below Chinese panels, among gayer
frocks where she lost colour, merged in a fluctuation
of dress. On the way home her restraint
snapped into a &#8220;Damn!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very stiff,&#8221; said Olive, &#8220;One reads about the
American informality. Tea at Sandringham is
giddy beside this. But Mrs. Marlett Smith&#8217;s
clever. Who were those twins in black velvet
who so violently kissed you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Vaneens. Ambrosine and Gretchen.
Knew them at school. They come out in
December.&mdash;But what maddens me is this
everlasting jabber about France! Some of those
girls know Gurdy. Their brothers were at Saint
Andrew&#8217;s with him. He seems to have made
himself frightfully conspicuous about Paris.&mdash;No,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
I&#8217;m bored with Gurdy. If dad tries to
make me marry him I&#8217;ll take poison and die to
slow music. Such tosh! He made a gesture of
enlisting&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re being silly,&#8221; Olive said, coldly hurt,
&#8220;and I&#8217;m sick of the word, gesture. Pray, was
the gesture of third rate artists and actors
who wouldn&#8217;t leave their work anything madly
glorious? I can understand a man conscious of
great talent preferring to stick to his last. And
I can understand a complete refusal to mix in the&mdash;abominable
business. But I&#8217;ve no patience
with dreary little wasters who shouted for blood
and then took acetanilid to cheat the doctors.
As for Gurdy&#8217;s military career he&#8217;s very quiet
about it. I dislike this venom against Gurdy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Margot chuckled, &#8220;Perhaps I&#8217;m jealous,&#8221; and
got down before the house. She opened the door
with her latchkey and they entered a flow of minor
music from the drawing room. Gurdy was playing.
Mark leaned on the curve of the piano and
his brown hands were deeply reflected in the
black pool of its top.</p>

<p>&#8220;Listen to this, Olive. Nigger song Gurdy
raked up for &#8216;Captain Salvador.&#8217; Sing it, sonny.
Don&#8217;t run off, Margot. Listen.&#8221; He caught
the girl to him, held her cheek against his chin.
A scent of mild sandal and cigarettes ebbed from
the black hair into his nostrils. He was tired<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
after the tense rehearsal and chilled from half
an hour in the cold of the Walling. This moving
warmth and scent was luxury. Mark shut his
eyes. Gurdy chanted in plausible barytone.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">&#8220;Life is like a mountain railway,</div>
<div class="verse">From the cradle to the grave.</div>
<div class="verse">Keep yoh hand upon the throttle</div>
<div class="verse">An&#8217; yoh eyes&mdash;upon&mdash;the&mdash;rail....&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>It would sound splendidly in the dim forecastle
of the first scene. It would float and die
under the blue vault of the Walling. He had just
seen the lights turned on a recession of faint silver
rims in the dull cloud of that ceiling. He was
still drugged by the sight. His theatre was like a
desirable body promised to his arms. Gurdy
played again the slow air in curious variations,
flutters of notes. Mark opened his eyes to
watch the slide of the long fingers on the keys.
Olive was smiling.</p>

<p>&#8220;Delightful. Very moral, too. Sound advice.
How well you play, Gurdy!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Always did,&#8221; said Mark, &#8220;He could play like
a streak when he was ten. Come along up and
have a fight with Mr. Carlson, daughter.&#8221;</p>

<p>Olive let Margot&#8217;s voice melt into the old
man&#8217;s cackle above. Gurdy said, &#8220;We went to
the Walling after rehearsal, Lady Ilden. Honestly,
it&#8217;s a corker. The ceiling&#8217;s nearly finished.
Theatres don&#8217;t last, worse luck. But there&#8217;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
nothing like it in the city. Mark&#8217;s worked like a
pup over it.&mdash;How was your tea?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very decent. Varieties of women, there.
Almost no men. A débutante told me she admired
Walt Whitman more than most English
poets and was rather positive that he was English.
I can&#8217;t understand the American tabu on Whitman.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Immoral.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But&mdash;good heavens!&mdash;I fascinated two elderly
girls by telling them I knew Swinburne.
Swinburne was lewd. Poor Whitman was merely
rather frank.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But Algie was a foreigner,&#8221; Gurdy laughed,
&#8220;so it was all right. Margot have a good time?&#8221;</p>

<p>Olive asked, &#8220;What were you and Margot
rowing about in the library last night? I could
hear her voice getting acid.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gurdy commenced a waltz and said, &#8220;We
weren&#8217;t rowing. Mark asked me whether Cosmo
Rand was in the British army. He wasn&#8217;t and
I said so. She seemed to think I was sniffing at
Rand and blew me up a little. That was all.
We made peace. I rather like Rand, you know,
now that he&#8217;s stopped making an ass of himself
at rehearsals. Russell and I had lunch with him
today. He talks well. He knows a lot about
painting, for instance. These actors who&#8217;ve been
all over the landscape and don&#8217;t think they&#8217;re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
better than Richard Mansfield&mdash;pretty interesting.
There&#8217;s not much to Rand but he isn&#8217;t a&mdash;a
walking egotism.&#8221;</p>

<p>Olive laughed, &#8220;Come back to Margot. She&#8217;s
pointedly offensive to you and rather assertive
about it. I hope you&#8217;ll go on being patient and
try to remember how young she is. You&#8217;re very
mature for twenty-one. You never bray. I
brayed very wildly at Margot&#8217;s age. I horribly
recall telling Henry Arthur Jones how to improve
his plays and one of my saddest memories is of
telling a nice Monsieur Thibault what a poor
novel Thaïs was. He quite agreed with me.
I didn&#8217;t know he was Anatole France until he left
the room. I&#8217;ve all the patience going with youth.
You&#8217;re almost too mature.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t know about being mature,&#8221; said Gurdy,
&#8220;I&#8217;m not, probably. But every other book you
read is all about youth&mdash;golden youth&mdash;youth
always finds a way&mdash;ferment. Get pretty tired
of it. Makes me want to be forty-nine. And
some of the poets make me sick. Hammering
their chests and saying, Yow! I&#8217;m young!...
Not their fault. I&#8217;m not proud of being
six foot one. Runs in the family.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a very cool bit of conversation, old
man. You&#8217;ve taken me away from Margot
twice, very tactfully, so I&#8217;ll drop it. Play some
Debussy. His music reminds me of a very handsome<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
man with too much scent on his coat. Can&#8217;t
approve of it. Rather like it.&#8221;</p>

<p>He evaded discussions of Margot until
Sunday night when he went with Mark to Boston
for the opening of &#8220;Captain Salvador&#8221; there.
On Monday night he sat, a spy, in the middle
of the large audience. A critic had come from
New York to see this play before it should reach
the metropolitan shoals. Gurdy saw the slender,
sharp face intent. The ten scenes of the Cuban
romance passed without a hitch before the placid
Bostonians. Mark was directing the lights that
raised peaks of gloom on the walls, sent shimmerings
along the moonlit beach where the hero
squatted in a purple shadow. About him Gurdy
heard appropriate murmurs. A fat woman whimpered
her objection to the half naked celebrants
of the Voodoo scene. An old man complained
that this was unlike life. Two smart matrons
chatted happily about a Harvard cabal against
some friend while &#8220;Captain Salvador&#8221; effected his
wooing. A thin boy in spectacles wailed an
argument that true art wasn&#8217;t possible in a capitalistic
nation. A girl giggled every time the
sailors of the story swore and almost whinnied
when the word, &#8220;strumpet&#8221; rattled over the lights.
But this herd redeemed itself in heavy applause.
The thin boy wailed a blanket assent to the merits<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
of the plot and the setting, &#8220;After all, Walling&#8217;s
Irish and he studied under Reinhardt in Berlin.
The Kelts have some feeling for values.&#8221; Still
the fat woman thought, loudly, that the play
didn&#8217;t prove anything and Gurdy decided that
one of his future satires must be named, The
Kingdom of Swine. He found Mark in high delight
behind the scenes, snapping directions to his
manager, his leading man and the electrician in
the New Jersey singsong. &#8220;Have the tomtom
some louder for the Voodoo, Ike. Bill, you send
all the notices special delivery to the Willard in
Washington. Mr. O&#8217;Mara&#8217;s in Hayti if the
<i>Transcript</i> wants an interview. Beach scene
blue enough, Gurdy? All right, Ed, I told you it
was. Now, Leslie, take your fall at the end
quieter, a little. You&#8217;re all right, the rest of it.
Come along, Gurdy. Taxi&#8217;s waiting.&#8221; In the
taxi, he cried, &#8220;Damn this lousy &#8216;Todgers&#8217; thing,
son! I want to stay here. People liked it,
huh?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They did.&mdash;Oh, you&#8217;re Irish and you learned
all your business from Reinhardt.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure! Blame, it on Europe!&mdash;My God,
didn&#8217;t the tomtom business go like a breeze?&mdash;Oh,
this &#8216;Todgers&#8217; thing&#8217;ll be too bad. Tell
you, I&#8217;ll play it in Washington and Philadelphia.
Baltimore, if it don&#8217;t just roll on its belly and die.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
Sorry if Margot gets sore.&mdash;She and Olive went
to Washington s&#8217;afternoon, didn&#8217;t they, huh?&mdash;Was
the ship scene light enough, sonny?&#8221;</p>

<p>He sat in their stateroom on the train, his eyes
still black with excitement and drank watered
brandy. He dreamed of &#8220;Captain Salvador&#8217;s&#8221;
first night at the Walling and tremors of applause
mounting to the blue vault of that perfected
ceiling. He was so tired that he struggled, undressing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mark, you&#8217;re thin as a bean! Nothing but
some muscles and skin.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mark flexed his arms, beamed up at the tall
boy&#8217;s anxiety and rolled into his berth. The
mussed red hair disappeared under a pillow.
Gurdy smoked and stared humbly.... This
was surely half of an artist, laborious, patient,
contriving beauty. The man had this strange
perception of the lovely thing. He should do
better and better. If his trade was that of the
booth, the sale of charming sensualities, he raised
it by his passion. He begot fondness. He created.
Gurdy tucked the blankets over the blue
silk pyjamas and planned a long talk on the purpose
of the theatre for the morning, then wondered
what that purpose was and put the lecture
off. They fled all morning down the land and
came to Washington in time for late lunch with
Russell at the Shoreham where Mark halted to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
look at a pretty, dark woman in the suave, grey
lounge smelling of flowers, fell behind Gurdy and
Russell, found himself suddenly lifting his hat to
Cora Boyle. She wore a cloak banded with
black fur and a gold hat too young for her paint.
Mark smiled, rather sorry for the blown coarseness
of her chin, asked how she liked California
and heard her flat voice crackle.</p>

<p>&#8220;A nightmare! All these girls who were absolutely
no one last week in ten thousand dollar
cars! No, I&#8217;m glad they brought me east. I&#8217;m
taking three days off to see Cosmo start this.
Tells me it plays here the rest of the week, then
Philadelphia.&mdash;When are you bringing it into
New York?&#8221;</p>

<p>He shifted a little and said, &#8220;Can&#8217;t say, Cora.
Hard to get a house in New York, right now.
This thing I&#8217;ve got at the Forty Fifth Street is
doin&#8217; big business. Todgers&#8217;ll be on the road
two weeks, anyhow, before I decide what&#8217;ll become
of it&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you opening the Walling with?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Captain Salvador.&#8217; Opened in Boston last
night. Best play I&#8217;ve ever touched! Say, remind
me to send you seats when it opens the
Walling.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s dear of you.&mdash;But couldn&#8217;t you get one
of the small houses for Cosmo? The Princess or
the Punch and Judy? Intimate comedy. Cosmo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
really does better in a small house. And&mdash;&#8221; she
smiled&mdash;&#8220;you could take a bigger one after a
month or so.&#8221;</p>

<p>He had an awed second of wonder. She&#8217;d
been almost thirty years on the stage and she
thought &#8220;Todgers Intrudes&#8221; a good play! He
began to say, &#8220;But, do you think this will&mdash;&#8221;
Then two men charged up to shake hands with the
actress. Mark scuttled down the stairs toward
the grill. If she was quarrelling with Rand her
manner didn&#8217;t show it. &#8220;Cosmo really does
better in a small house.&#8221; He joined Russell and
Gurdy at their table, puzzled and said, &#8220;Say, if
she&#8217;s fighting with Rand it&#8217;s funny she&#8217;d come
down to see him open this flapdoodle.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Habit,&#8221; Russell shrugged, &#8220;They&#8217;ve been
married twelve years. But are they fighting?
I had breakfast with them this morning and she
almost crucified herself because his tea wasn&#8217;t
right.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mark wondered why Margot thought that
Rand and the woman quarrelled. But he shed
the wonder. He liked Washington especially
as the pale city showed itself now in a vapour
where the abiding leaves seemed glazed in their
red and yellow along the streets. Olive knew
people here. There was a tea with a British
attaché. Margot&#8217;s rose cloth suit gleamed about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
the dancing floor of the restaurant. Gurdy had
friends who were produced, fell subject to Margot
and came between the acts that night to lean
over the girl&#8217;s chair in the box of the big theatre.
&#8220;Todgers Intrudes&#8221; went its placid course.
Rand gave, Mark fancied, an excellent imitation
of an English conservative. The packed house
laughed at the right points. Margot&#8217;s face rippled
so eagerly that Mark wanted to kiss it and
covertly held her hand below the rail. Why, this
was the pretty, gentle sort of nonsense eighteen
years would relish! A pity it had no staying
wit. A pity this fragile, polished man she so admired
wasn&#8217;t a real comedian. Mark looked at
Gurdy&#8217;s stolid boredom and the fine chest hidden
by the dinner jacket beyond Olive&#8217;s bare shoulders.
It might be as well to let Gurdy tell Margot
the play wouldn&#8217;t do for New York. Mark
shrank from that. Gurdy could put the thing
much better in his cool, bred fashion.&mdash;Here
and there men were leaving the theatre with an
air of final retirement. In the opposite box there
was a waving of feathers. How well Cora Boyle
could use a fan!&mdash;A youngster with curly orange
hair slipped into his box as the second curtain fell.
Gurdy introduced young Theodore Jannan to
Olive and Margot, then to Mark. Mr. Jannan
had come over from Philadelphia to do something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
in Washington. This play&mdash;the Jannan heir bit
off a &#8220;rotten&#8221;&mdash;was advertised as coming to
Philadelphia next week.</p>

<p>&#8220;Opens there Monday,&#8221; said Mark.</p>

<p>&#8220;My mother&#8217;s giving a baby dance for my sister.
Couldn&#8217;t you bring Miss Walling, Gurdy?
Monday night.&#8221;</p>

<p>How smoothly Margot said she&#8217;d like to come
to a dance at Mrs. Apsley Jannan&#8217;s house in Philadelphia!
The nonsense of social position! An
illusion. A little training, a little charm, good
clothes.&mdash;A Healy, one of Margot&#8217;s cousins, had
risen to be a foreman in one of the Jannan steel
mills.&mdash;Gurdy had played football with this pleasant
lad at Saint Andrew&#8217;s school. Who on earth
would ever know or care that Margot and Gurdy
were born on a farm? The last curtain fell.
Margot wanted to dance. Russell came to join
the party. They went to a restaurant and found
a table at the edge of the oval floor. Margot&#8217;s
yellow frock was swept off into the florid seething
on Gurdy&#8217;s arm. Russell poured brandy neatly into
the coffee pot and shrugged to Mark.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bad sign. Fifteen or twenty men left in the
second act. We&#8217;ll have a vile time in Philadelphia,
Lady Ilden. It&#8217;s a queer town on plays.&mdash;There
come the Rands.&#8221;</p>

<p>A headwaiter lifted a &#8220;Reserved&#8221; sign from a
table across the floor. Cora Boyle and her husband<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
appeared in the light threaded by cigarette
smoke. The actress draped a green and black
skirt carelessly, refused to dance with a British
officer in a trim pantomime, bowed slowly to
Mark who was taken with fright. She&#8217;d want to
talk about this drivelling play and before her
slight, quiet husband. He slipped a bill under
the edge of Russell&#8217;s plate.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bring Olive back to the hotel will you
Russell? I&#8217;m all in. &#8217;Night, Olive.&#8221;</p>

<p>His retreat through the smoky tables was
comic. Russell fingered his chin. Olive ended
by laughing, &#8220;He&#8217;s ridiculously timid about her.&#8221;</p>

<p>The director patted his bald forehead and
drank some coffee. He said, &#8220;It happens that
he&#8217;s got some reason. Miss Boyle&#8217;s bad tempered
and an inveterate liar. She&#8217;s fond of her
husband and she seems to think this comedy will
have a New York run. Mr. Walling means to
let it die on the road, naturally. She won&#8217;t like
that. She&#8217;ll talk. Her voice will be loud all up
and down Broadway.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But&mdash;surely he&#8217;s callous to that sort of
thing?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you see anything callous about him? I
don&#8217;t.&#8221; The director nodded to the floating of
Margot&#8217;s skirt. &#8220;This is the first time I&#8217;ve ever
directed a play put on to please a débutante,
Lady Ilden.&mdash;No, Mr. Walling seems mighty sensitive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
to gossip.&mdash;And Cora Boyle&#8217;s in a strong
position. She&#8217;s a woman&mdash;obviously&mdash;and she
can make a good yarn. Spite, and so on. She&#8217;s
quite capable of giving out interviews on the subject.
She can&#8217;t hurt Mr. Walling but she might
cause any quantity of gossip,&mdash;which he couldn&#8217;t
very well answer. She can play the woman
wronged, you see?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What a nation of woman worshippers you
are!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Were,&#8221; said Russell, &#8220;We&#8217;re getting over it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see any signs of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Russell said, &#8220;You can&#8217;t send two million men
into countries where women&mdash;well, admit that
they&#8217;re human, not goddesses, anyhow, without
getting a reaction. My wife&#8217;s a lawyer. She
helped a young fellow&mdash;an ex-soldier&mdash;out of
some trouble the other day and he told her she
was almost as nice as a foreigner&mdash;Ten years ago
if Cora Boyle had wanted to have a fight with
Mr. Walling she could have taken the line that he
was jealous of Rand and she&#8217;d have found newspapers
that would print front page columns about
it. She&#8217;d get about two paragraphs now.&mdash;But
she probably has better sense. Beastly handsome,
isn&#8217;t she?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very&mdash;brutta bestia bella. Gurdy tells me
she&#8217;s paid a thousand dollars a day to play Camille
for the cinema. Why?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>&#8220;Oh ... she&#8217;s the kind of thing a lot of
respectable middle aged women adore, I think.&mdash;Look
at them.&#8221;</p>

<p>There were many women in the rim of tables.
They stared at the flaring green and black gown,
at the exhibited bawdry of gold wrought calves,
at the feathers of the waving, profuse fan.
There was an attitude of furtive adventure in the
turn of heads. They stared, disapproved,
perhaps envied.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Some men in this, some that, their pleasure
take, but every woman is at heart a rake,&#8217;&#8221; Olive
quoted.</p>

<p>The director laughed, &#8220;You&#8217;re right.&mdash;And I
often think that the movie queens take the place
of an aristocracy in this country. Something very
fast and bold for the women to stare at. Now
Rand, there, is the ideal aristocrat&mdash;in appearance,
anyhow, don&#8217;t you think? And nobody&#8217;s
looking at him. I wonder if Miss Walling would
dance with me?&#8221;</p>

<p>He relieved Gurdy close to the Rand table.
When the boy joined Olive she asked, &#8220;Mr.
Russell isn&#8217;t a typical stage director, is he?...
I thought not. One of the new school in your
theatre? A well educated man?... Rather
entertaining.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He writes a little. Been an engineer. Stage
directors are weird. One of them used to be an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
Egyptologist.&mdash;I say, help me keep Mark here the
rest of the week, will you? He&#8217;s dead tired.
Did he run when he saw Cora Boyle coming?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. He seems positively afraid of her!&#8221;</p>

<p>Gurdy said, &#8220;He is afraid of her. Great Scott,
he was only sixteen when he married her and dad
says he was&mdash;pretty blooming innocent. Mark&#8217;s
all full of moral conventions, Lady Ilden. Ever
noticed that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When you were in pinafores, my child! I
always thought he&#8217;d shed some of his Puritan
fancies. He doesn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Grandfather&#8217;s awfully strict, even if he is an
atheist. And mother ... isn&#8217;t what you&#8217;d call
reckless. They brought him up. And he still
thinks their ... well, moral standards are just
about right.&mdash;I&#8217;m the same way. Got it pounded
into me at school that bad grammar and loud
clothes were immoral. Don&#8217;t suppose I&#8217;ll get
over that.&mdash;Mark says he&#8217;s never flirted with a
married woman in his life.&#8221;</p>

<p>Olive yawned, &#8220;I don&#8217;t suppose that he has,
consciously. Oh, to be sure, I can understand
why Mark would think of Miss Boyle as the Scarlet
Woman. The Puritan upbringing.&mdash;We
never quite get over early influences, Gurdy. I
always find myself bristling a bit over dropped
H&#8217;s even when a famous novelist does the dropping.&mdash;Mark
prophesies bad reviews for the play,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
in the morning. Do leave word to have the
papers sent up to me. I&#8217;m so sleepy I shall forget
about it.&mdash;Thank heaven, Margot&#8217;s stopped
dancing.&#8221;</p>

<p>In their double bedroom at the New Willard
Margot talked jauntily of &#8220;Todgers Intrudes,&#8221;
until Olive fell asleep wondering why the girl
should interpret amiable laughter as the shout of
success. In the morning two newspapers arrived
with breakfast. The critics praised the acting
and both sniffed at the play. Olive read the
columns over her tea. Both critics dealt kindly
with Rand. One thought his manner resembled
that of Cyril Maude, the other said that
he imitated George Arliss. Margot came
trailing a green robe from the bathtub and stood
pressed against the brass bedfoot reading the
comments. The sun redoubled on her silver girdle
and the numerous polychrome tassels of the
foolish, charming drapery inside which her
body stirred before she cried, &#8220;How American!
Thin! It&#8217;s no thinner than that rot dad has
running at the Forty Fifth Street!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My darling Margot, that&#8217;s thin American
comedy. It&#8217;s something national, comprehensible.
As for &#8216;Todgers,&#8217; why&mdash;why should you
expect a pack of American war office clerks and
provincials to care whether a Baron precedes an
Earl or no? I can&#8217;t help being surprised that so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
many of them seemed to know what it was all
about! The play is thin&mdash;horribly thin. I&#8217;m
sure it did well at home on account of Maurice
Ealy&#8217;s following. The critics say rather nice
things about Rand, all things considered....
Well, were you impressed with him last night?
Do you still think he&#8217;s a fine actor?&#8221;</p>

<p>Margot tilted her face toward the ceiling and
the sun made a visard across her narrowed eyes.
She twisted the silver girdle between her hands
and stood silent. Olive felt the final barrier between
creatures, suddenly and keenly. She had
lived in intimacy with the girl for five years.
Here was a strange mind revolving under the
black, carven hair and the mask of sun.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I didn&#8217;t think him very good, last night.
Nervous.&mdash;And perhaps the play did seem rather
thin.... But it&#8217;ll do better in New York.
More civilized people, there.&#8221;</p>

<p>Olive lifted her breakfast tray to the bedside
table and thought. Then her patience snapped,
before the girl&#8217;s sunny and motionless certitude.
She said, &#8220;New York! Do you think Mark
will risk bringing this poor ghost of a thing to
New York? Hardly! He told me last night
it will be played in Philadelphia and Baltimore,
then he&#8217;ll discard it.&mdash;You&#8217;re silly, dearest!
The play&#8217;s wretched and Rand&#8217;s no better than
a hundred other young leading men I&#8217;ve seen.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
He appeals to you for some reason or other.
He seems very, very feeble to me. He has no
virility, no&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>The silver girdle broke between the tawny
hands. Margot&#8217;s face rippled. She said loudly,
&#8220;This is all Gurdy! He doesn&#8217;t like the play!
He&#8217;s made dad dislike it. He&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Olive cut in, &#8220;I shan&#8217;t listen to that! That&#8217;s
mere ill temper and untrue. The play is a waste
of Mark&#8217;s time and of his money.&mdash;Between your
very exaggerated loyalty to Ronny Dufford and
your liking for this doll of an actor you&#8217;ve probably
cost Mark three or four thousand pounds.
He produced this play entirely to please you.
Don&#8217;t tease him any farther. Don&#8217;t try to make
him bring this nonsense to New York. You&#8217;ve a
dreadful power over Mark. Don&#8217;t trade on it!
You&#8217;re behaving like a spoiled child. You disappoint
me!&#8221;</p>

<p>The black eyes widened. Margot pushed herself
back from the bed with both hands, staring.
She said, &#8220;I&mdash;I dare say.... Sorry.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You should be!... He&#8217;s done everything
he can to keep you amused. He isn&#8217;t a millionaire.
You&#8217;ve been treated like a mistress of
extravagant tastes, not like a daughter! There
is such a thing as gratitude. He&#8217;s humoured you
in regard to this silly play and in regard to Rand.
Gurdy and Mr. Russell tell me that Cora Boyle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
can make herself a disgusting nuisance now that
the play&#8217;s a failure. You&#8217;ve pushed Mark into
this very bad bargain. Don&#8217;t make it worse by
whimpering, now, and don&#8217;t&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, please!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then please bite on the bullet and let&#8217;s hear
no more of this. When Mark tells you he&#8217;ll
drop the play, don&#8217;t tease him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Margot said, &#8220;Poor Ronny Dufford! I
thought&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry Ronny&#8217;s broke. It&#8217;s the destiny of
younger sons whose fathers had a taste for baccarat.
I shall start for Japan as soon as I&#8217;ve
seen the Walling opened. I shan&#8217;t go in a very
easy frame of mind if I feel that you&#8217;ve constituted
yourself a charitable committee of one
with Mark as treasurer.&#8221;</p>

<p>Olive laughed. Margot said, &#8220;Yes, m&#8217;lady,&#8221;
and made a curtsey, then fluttered off to telephone
for breakfast, began to chuckle and the
delicate chime of that mirth was soothing, after
the rasp of Olive&#8217;s tirade. The girl seemed unresentful.
Olive had never so seriously scolded
her. Now she thought that she should talk to
Mark about his folly. This idolatry was delightful
to watch but unhealthy, a temptation to
Margot. The girl had other pets in London.
There was an amateur actress constantly wobbling
on the edge of professional engagements. Two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
or three of the young painters experimented in
stage setting. She deliberated and listed these
artists to Mark while they were driving about
the broad city in a hired victoria.</p>

<p>&#8220;All nice children and hopeless dabblers, old
man. Beware of them or you&#8217;ll have the house
filled with immigrants. Rand&#8217;s a giant beside
any of them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The little man ain&#8217;t so bad. Guess I&#8217;ll put
him in as leading man for a woman in a Scotch
play I&#8217;m going to work on after Christmas.
That&#8217;ll shut Cora Boyle up. He&#8217;ll do, all right.
I&#8217;ll offer him the part when I tell him &#8216;Todgers&#8217;
goes to Cain&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To&mdash;where?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a warehouse in New York where dead
plays go&mdash;the scenery, I mean.&#8221; Mark pointed
to a full wreath of steam floating above the Pan
American building, &#8220;Watch it go. No wind.
Ought to last a minute.&mdash;Busted,&#8221; he sighed, as
the lovely cream melted. &#8220;But I ain&#8217;t sorry this
happened, Olive. Teach her she don&#8217;t know so
much about the show business. &#8216;Todgers&#8217;ll&#8217;
make a little money here because the town&#8217;s
packed full. But I&#8217;m afraid Philadelphia&#8217;ll be
its Waterloo. Well, the Boston <i>Transcript</i> had
three columns on &#8216;Captain Salvador.&#8217; It&#8217;s in the
biggest theatre in Boston and they had standing
room only last night. Gurdy got a wire from a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
kid he knows in Harvard that a couple of professors
came out of the woods and told their classes
to go see the thing.&#8221;</p>

<p>His talk came turning back to &#8220;Captain
Salvador&#8221; for the rest of the week. He was
bodily listless after the strain of the Boston production.
Gurdy forced him to play golf and
tramp the spread city when Olive and Margot
were at teas in the British colony. Russell often
walked and every night dined with them, examining
Margot with his sharp hazel eyes so that
Gurdy fancied the man exhaling her essence with
his cigarette smoke. He sat with Gurdy on Monday
afternoon in the smoking car on the road to
Philadelphia and observed, &#8220;Miss Walling&#8217;s very
much interested in &#8216;Todgers.&#8217; How will she take
the blow when it fails, here? It&#8217;ll be a flat failure,
tonight, Gurdy. See if it isn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Margot and I are going to a dance. We
shan&#8217;t see it flop.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;ll flop very flat and hard. I&#8217;m a Philadelphian.
You should warn Miss Walling.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mark startled Gurdy by warning Margot during
tea in the small suite of the Philadelphia
hotel while she stood at the tin voiced piano rattling
tunes with one hand. Mark said nervously,
&#8220;Now, sister, if &#8216;Todgers&#8217; is a fluke here&mdash;why, I
can&#8217;t waste time and cash fooling with it any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
longer.&#8221; He coughed and finished, &#8220;I&#8217;ll send
your friend Dufford a check and&mdash;amen.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re an old duck,&#8221; said Margot, &#8220;and I&#8217;ll
be good. Shan&#8217;t ever try to choose another play
for you&mdash;never, never, never.&#8221; She tinkled the
negro song from &#8220;Captain Salvador&#8221; tapping one
foot so that the silver buckle sparkled. &#8220;Wish
I could sing.... Life is like a&mdash;what&#8217;s good old
life like, Gurdy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Like a mountain railway.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That a simile or a metaphor?&mdash;I say, I must
get scrubbed. Six o&#8217;clock.&#8221;</p>

<p>She passed Gurdy, leaving the room. He saw
her teeth white against the red translucency of her
lower lip and carmine streaks rising in her face,
but her door shut slowly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Took it like a Trojan,&#8221; Mark proudly said,
&#8220;Guess the Washington papers opened her eyes
some. Well, let&#8217;s go see if Russell&#8217;s downstairs,
Gurd. He&#8217;s got a room on this floor. Gad,
Olive, I wish we were goin&#8217; to a dance tonight
instead of this&mdash;junk.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Margot should wear something very smart for
this dance, shouldn&#8217;t she?&#8221; Olive asked. &#8220;The
Jannans are the mighty of earth, aren&#8217;t they?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Old family. Steel mills,&#8221; Gurdy explained.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve met some of them in Scotland. Wasn&#8217;t
there a Miss Jannan who did something extraordinary?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
I remember a row in the New York
papers. Didn&#8217;t she&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Mark laughed, &#8220;Ran off with a married man.
They&#8217;ve got a couple of kids, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Doesn&#8217;t that domestic touch redeem the performance,
Mark?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mark chuckled and drawled, &#8220;Now, here!
You make out you&#8217;re a wild eyed radical and so
on. Suppose some girl that ought to know better
came and lived next you in Chelsea with a married
man. Ask her to dinner?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I cheerfully would if I thought her worth
knowing, gentle Puritan! If I thought she was
simply a sloppy, uncontrolled sentimentalist I
should no more bother myself than I would to
meet a society preacher or some hero of the
Russian ballet who&#8217;s paid a hundred guineas a
night to exhibit his abdominal surface in the name
of art.... Six o&#8217;clock. I should tub, myself.
I&#8217;ve several cinders on my spine. Run along,
both of you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mark said on the way to the elevators, &#8220;Olive&#8217;s
a wonder, ain&#8217;t she, bud? Don&#8217;t know why but
she always puts me in mind of your dad. Calm
and cool.&mdash;Oh, say, tomorrow&#8217;s your mamma&#8217;s
birthday!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is. And I&#8217;m going up to the farm, after
lunch. &#8216;Todgers Intrudes&#8217; has got me&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shut up,&#8221; said Mark, seeing Cosmo Rand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
ringing the button for the elevator. He beamed
at the actor and asked in the car, &#8220;Mrs. Rand
went back to New York?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. Just been talking to her by &#8217;phone.
They started the film of &#8216;Camille&#8217; today. Very
trying, she said. They&#8217;ve some promoted cowboy
playing Armand.&mdash;I say, I&#8217;ve some quite decent
gin in my flask. We might have a cocktail.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gurdy thought how clever the man was to wear
grey, increasing his height and embellishing his
rosy skin. He understood dress expertly. At
the Jannan dance, toward midnight, a girl told
him that she&#8217;d just come from a &#8220;simply idiotic
play&#8221; but praised Rand&#8217;s appearance. &#8220;Englishmen
do turn themselves out so well.&#8221;</p>

<p>The dance was supported by sparkling Moselle
and Gurdy didn&#8217;t have to perform with Margot.
She found friends. He was summoned to be introduced
to a young Mrs. Calder who at once invited
him to dine the next evening. Gurdy excused
himself on the score of his mother&#8217;s birthday.
As they drove away from the emptying
house Margot explained, &#8220;Peggy Calder&#8217;s nice.
She was in the Red Cross in London. You&#8217;re
really going up to the farm?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly.&#8221;</p>

<p>She said nothing, restless in her dark cloak for
a time then chattered about the Jannan grandeur.
She enjoyed spectacles. The great suburban<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
house and the green ballroom pleased her. &#8220;But
you people drink too much, you know? Mrs.
Jannan&#8217;s a second wife, isn&#8217;t she? Rather pretty.
Heavens, what a long way back to the hotel!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re tired.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Frightfully. And blue.... Can&#8217;t you make
dad try &#8216;Todgers&#8217; in New York, Gurdy?&#8221;
Directly and with a sharp motion she added, &#8220;No.
That&#8217;s utterly silly. I&#8217;ve no business asking
it.... But I do feel&mdash;And yet I don&#8217;t know the
New York taste&mdash;You really think it wouldn&#8217;t
do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I really don&#8217;t, Margot. And you can&#8217;t get a
theatre for love, blood or money. They&#8217;re
even trying to buy theatres to bring plays into.
Mark would have to run the play on the road for
weeks&mdash;months, perhaps, before he could get a
theatre.&#8221;</p>

<p>She dropped the matter, spoke of the dance
again and at the hotel hurried up the corridor to
her rooms. Mark sat up as Gurdy slid into the
other bed of his chamber and passed a hand across
his throat, &#8220;Oh, son, what an evening! &#8216;Todgers&#8217;
to the boneyard! Crape on the door!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fizzled? People were knocking it at the
Jannan&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Awful! Every one coughed. I will say Rand
worked hard. No, it&#8217;s dead. I&#8217;ll let it run tomorrow
night and then close it.&mdash;Stick with me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
tomorrow. I&#8217;ll have to break the bad news to
Rand.&#8221;</p>

<p>He broke the news to Rand just as Gurdy was
leaving to take the train for Trenton, after lunch.
The actor strolled up to them beside the door,
a grey furred coat over his arm and his bronze
eyes patently anxious.</p>

<p>&#8220;Going away, Bernamer?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The country.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Decent day for it.... I say, Walling, they
weren&#8217;t nice to us in the papers.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gurdy saw Mark begin to act. The voice
deepened to its kindest drawl. Mark said, &#8220;Just
called up the theatre. Only sold two hundred
seats for tonight and its almost three, now.
That&#8217;s too bad.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rand passed the polished nails along the soft
moustache. The sun of the door sent true gold
into his hair. He murmured, &#8220;Shocking bad,
eh? We play Baltimore, next week, don&#8217;t we?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Mark, easily, &#8220;It&#8217;s too thin. I&#8217;ll
close it tonight.&mdash;Now, I&#8217;m putting on a piece
called the &#8216;Last Warrior.&#8217; English. Start rehearsals
after Christmas. Good part for you in
that. Marion Hart&#8217;s the lead. Know her?
Nice to play with and a damned good play.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh&mdash;thanks awfully.&mdash;Yes, I know Miss
Hart.&mdash;Thanks very much, sir.... You shan&#8217;t
risk bringing &#8216;Todgers&#8217; to New York?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>&#8220;No. I&#8217;m sorry. You&#8217;ve worked mighty
hard and I like your work. You&#8217;ll be a lot better
off in this other play.... &#8216;Todgers&#8217; is too thin,
Rand. Might have done five or six years back.&#8221;</p>

<p>The actor nodded. &#8220;Dare say you&#8217;re right,
sir. Bit of a bubble, really. And awfully good
of you to want me for this other thing. Be delighted
to try.... Yes, this was rather bubblish:&mdash;Anyhow,
this lets me out of Baltimore.
I do hate that town. Well, thanks ever so.
Better luck next time, let&#8217;s hope.&#8221;</p>

<p>He walked off, grey into the duller grey of the
columned lounge. Mark nodded after him.
&#8220;Took it damned well, Gurdy. He&#8217;ll be all right
in this other show and Cora can&#8217;t say I haven&#8217;t
been decent to him. Well, hustle along. Got
that whiskey for your dad? Give &#8217;em my love.&mdash;Look
at that pink car, for lordsake! Vulgarity
on four wheels, huh?&mdash;So long, sonny.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gurdy was glad that Rand hadn&#8217;t whined. This
was a feeble, tame fellow without much attraction
beyond his handsome face. Perhaps it was for
this mannerly tameness that Margot liked him.
Perhaps that fable of women liking the masterly
male was faulty. Margot liked to domineer.
She had bullied Rand a trifle at the rehearsal in
London. Perhaps Cora Boyle liked the tame
little creature for some such reason. Gurdy
dismissed him and the theatre. There was vexing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
sadness in the collapse of even so poor a
play. Russell and the actors had worked. It
came to nothing. Bubble! Expensive, futile,
unheroic evanescence. Margot&#8217;s fault. He
mustn&#8217;t let Mark do such a thing again. The
girl must confine her restless self to dances and
clothes. She had looked very well at the Jannan
party. She had smartness, instant magnetism.
She was still asleep and would dine with her
acquaintance, Mrs. Calder, tonight. Gurdy
yawned as Trenton foully spouted its industry
toward the sky. Bernamer was waiting with the
car at the station, gave him a crushing hug and
told him that he looked like hell.</p>

<p>&#8220;Danced all night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I see you did in the <i>Ledger</i>. Among those
present at the Apsley Jannan&#8217;s party. Your
mamma&#8217;s all upset about it. Saw a movie of a
millionaire party with naked hussies ridin&#8217;
ostriches in the conserv&#8217;tory. She thinks Margot&#8217;s
led you astray. How&#8217;s this &#8216;Tod&#8217; play
done?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all done, dad. Closes tonight.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bernamer sent the car through Trenton and
cursed Margot astoundingly. &#8220;Ten or twelve
thousand dollars! The little skunk! Cure Mark
of listening to her. Say, he still wanting you to
marry her, bud?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Afraid he is, dad.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>&#8220;Sure. Next best he could do to marryin&#8217; her
himself. Funny boy. Likes her &#8217;cause she&#8217;s
pretty. Black hair.&mdash;This English woman&#8217;s
blackheaded, ain&#8217;t she?... Well, you sic&#8217; some
feller onto Margot and get her off Mark&#8217;s hands.
If you fell in love with her again, your mamma&#8217;d
puff up and bust.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Again?&#8221;</p>

<p>Bernamer gave him a blue stare and winked,
wrinkling his nose. His weathered face creased
into a snort. &#8220;Sure, you were losin&#8217; sleep over
her &#8217;fore she got back from England.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not now, daddy.&#8221; Gurdy wondered about
the absolute death of his passion. His father,
who so seldom saw him, knew it was done. Mark
saw him daily, talked to him of Margot urgently
and saw nothing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Bernamer, &#8220;Mark&#8217;s awful fond of
you. And you ain&#8217;t bad, reelly. Don&#8217;t you get
married until you catch one you can stand for
steady diet. Oh, your mamma&#8217;s gone on a vegetable
diet and lost four pounds in two weeks.
Ed&#8217;s got a boil on his neck&mdash;bad, too, poor pup.
Jim done an algebra problem right yesterday and
made a touchdown Saturday. He&#8217;s got his head
swelled a mile.&#8221;</p>

<p>The man&#8217;s tolerant dealing with his family impressed
Gurdy. Here was a controlled and level
affection, not Mark&#8217;s worship. It was a healthier<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
thing. He watched his father&#8217;s amiable scorn
while Mrs. Bernamer and the whole household
fussed variously over young Edward&#8217;s inflamed
neck after supper. The boil was central in the
talk of the red living room. Grandfather
Walling tried to think of some ancient remedy
and fell asleep pondering. The two bigger lads
hovered and chuckled over the eruption. The
sisters neglected some swains who came calling.
Mrs. Bernamer sat mending the grey breeches of
the military uniform Edward wasn&#8217;t wearing.
The boil maintained itself over gossip of the village,
the Military Academy and female questions
about the Jannan dance. At ten Bernamer said,
&#8220;Go to bed, all of you. Got to talk business to
Gurdy.&#8221; The family kissed Gurdy and departed.
Grandfather Walling&#8217;s snore roamed tenderly
down into the stillness. Bernamer got out the
chessboard and uncorked a bottle of vicious pear
cider. They smoked and played the endless
game. At twelve the telephone bell shore off
his father&#8217;s sentences. Gurdy clapped a palm on
the jangling at his elbow and picked up the instrument.
Olive Ilden spoke in her most artificial,
clearest voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re in New York, dear. The doctor telephoned
about eight and we came up directly. I
think you&#8217;d best come, Gurdy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Carlson?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>&#8220;Yes. He&#8217;ll be gone in a few hours. Mark&#8217;s
so distressed and&mdash;the old man asked for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bernamer said, &#8220;No train until three thirty,
son.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll get there as fast, as I can,&#8221; Gurdy told her,
&#8220;Margot there?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. She&#8217;d gone to dine with her friend&mdash;Mrs.
Calder&mdash;and Mark didn&#8217;t want her here.
I&#8217;ll tell Mark you&#8217;re coming, then. Good-bye.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gurdy rang off. His father nodded, &#8220;Mark&#8217;ll
miss the old feller. Been mighty good to him.
Funny old man. Always liked him. Poor
Mark! Well, you say this Englishwoman&#8217;s sensible.
That&#8217;s some help.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gurdy was glad of Olive&#8217;s sanity, wished that
the thought of this death didn&#8217;t make his heart
thump for a little. His father would drive him
into Trenton at two. They played chess again.
Bernamer made sandwiches of beef and thick
bread. The red walls clouded with cigarette
smoke. It was two when the bell again rang.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dead, prob&#8217;ly,&#8221; said Bernamer.</p>

<p>The operator asked for Gurdy. There was a
shrill wrangling of women behind which a man
spoke loudly and savagely. His impatience
cracked through the buzzing. It wasn&#8217;t Mark
when the man spoke clearly at last.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is Russell, Gurdy. Can you hear? You
must come here at once.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>&#8220;To Philadelphia? What&#8217;s happened? Mr.
Carlson&#8217;s dying and&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know. And I can&#8217;t bother Walling. You
must come here as fast as you can. Can you
speak German?... I&#8217;ll try to talk French;
then.&#8221;</p>

<p>After a moment Gurdy said, &#8220;All right. I&#8217;ll
come as fast as I can. Get hold of the hotel manager.
Money&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The detective&#8217;s got a check. That&#8217;s all right.
Hurry up, though.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gurdy found himself standing and dropped
the telephone. It brushed the chessmen in a
clattering volley to the floor. His father&#8217;s blue
eyes bit through the smoke.</p>

<p>&#8220;When&#8217;s a train to Philadelphia, dad?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That damn fool girl gone and got herself
into&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This actor!... Of course she has! Of
course! Oh, hell! In her room! When&#8217;s
there a train to Philadelphia?&#8221;</p>

The Idolater</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">OLIVE left the telephone table and strolled
across the bright library to the fire. The
sussuration of dragged silk behind her
moving gown gave her a queer discomfort;
there had been no time to change in the rush; it
seemed improper to attend a death-bed in evening
dress. And she was intrusive, here, and helpless.
Mark&#8217;s pain was calm. He would suffer later,
at the end of these hours or minutes. The
bored, plump doctor came into the library, closed
the door and lit a cigarette, joining Olive at the
warm hearth.</p>

<p>&#8220;He was asking for Miss Walling, just now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah? She&#8217;s in Philadelphia. She was dining
with some friends at the Ritz, there, so we left
her.&#8221;</p>

<p>The doctor said, &#8220;Very sensible,&#8221; and blew a
smoke ring. Under its dissolution his eyes admired
Olive&#8217;s shoulders then, the pastel of Gurdy
in a black frame on the mantel.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell me,&#8221; Olive asked, &#8220;how&mdash;how far is he
conscious?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>&#8220;It would be interesting to know. In these
collapses we&#8217;re not sure. His conscious mind
probably asserts itself, now and then. The unconscious&mdash;I
really can&#8217;t say. Still, before you
and Mr. Walling came he spoke in Swedish several
times. And that&#8217;s the unconscious. He forgot
his Swedish years ago. Been in this country
ever since eighteen sixty-eight. But he spoke
Swedish quite correctly and very fast. I&#8217;m a
Swede. It surprised me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed,&#8221; said Olive and shivered before his
science, cool, weary, not much interested.</p>

<p>The doctor looked at his watch, murmured,
&#8220;Twelve thirty,&#8221; and tossed his cigarette in the
fire. He observed, &#8220;But the old gentleman&#8217;s in
no pain. The reversion&#8217;s very interesting. He
was talking to some one about Augustin Daly.
Very interesting.&#8221; The clipped, brisk voice denied
the least interest. The doctor went from
the library as Olive heard wheels halt outside.
This couldn&#8217;t be Gurdy. She looked through a
window and recognized her maid paying a taxicab
driver. The black and yellow taxicab trembled
behind a car entirely black and windowless;
the undertaker awaited Carlson&#8217;s body. Olive
drew the curtains across the glass, shook herself
and went down to speak with her maid.</p>

<p>&#8220;Margot hadn&#8217;t come back from her dinner
when you came away, Lane?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>&#8220;No, m&#8217;lady. Such a noosance getting the
luggage to the station, down there.... Might
I have some tea in your pantry, Mr. Collins?&#8221;
the woman asked Mark&#8217;s butler as Olive turned
away. These two would sit in the butler&#8217;s pantry
drinking tea and discussing deaths. Olive went
up the soft stairs and into Carlson&#8217;s bedroom behind
the library. She entered an immutable
group. The two nurses sat in a corner. The
doctor examined one of the framed, old photographs
that pallidly gleamed on the walls made
brown by the lowered light. Mark stood with
his hands clutching the white bedfoot. His black
seemed to rise supernatural from the floor. He
was taller, thinner. He glared at the stretched
length of his patron. To Olive the dying man
appeared more like an exhumed Pharaoh than
ever. The yellow head was unchanged. She
had a dizzy, picturesque fancy that his eyes might
open, that he might speak in some unknown, sonorous
dialect of the Nile. As she dropped a
hand beside Mark&#8217;s fingers on the rail the old man
spoke without breath in a sound of torn fabric
yet with an airy, human amusement. &#8220;All right,
Mister Caz&#8217;nove. Don&#8217;t git flustered. I&#8217;ll tell
Miss Morris.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mark writhed. The plastron of his shirt
crackled. He gripped Olive&#8217;s arm and drew her
from the room. In the hall he panted, &#8220;Augustin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
Daly&#8217;s prompter&mdash;a Frenchman&mdash;I guess he
meant Clara Morris.&#8221; But in the cooler hall,
away from the insufferable bed, he was ashamed.
This was bad behaviour, unmanly, ridiculous. He
smiled timidly at Olive who suddenly put her
hands on his face and kissed him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I talked to Gurdy. He&#8217;ll be here as soon as
he can, dear.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thanks. Got to go back.&#8221; Mark sighed,
&#8220;You go to bed, though.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mark didn&#8217;t want her to go to bed. He smiled
and went back to his watch. Odious time passed.
The smell of cigarettes crept from the walls and
the furniture. Carlson had smoked many thousands
here. One of the nurses clicked a string of
beads. The tiny cross was silver and lustrous
as it swung. The beads seemed amethyst.
What good did the woman think she was doing?
But she had liked Carlson. She was praying for
his soul and Carlson thought he had a soul.
Let her pray. The amethyst flicker soothed
Mark, took his eyes from the bed. The voice
surprised him with his name.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mark.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yessir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a poor house. Rain....&#8221;</p>

<p>Mark&#8217;s throat was full of dry fire. He
gripped the rail, waiting. But the voice did not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
come again. After four the doctor nodded.
One nurse yawned. The Irishwoman fell gently
on her knees under the large, signed photograph
of Ada Rehan in the frilled, insolent dress of
Lady Teazle. Olive led Mark quickly from the
room into the library. He pressed his hands on
his eyes. He wouldn&#8217;t cry over this. Carlson
had too often called him a crybaby, a big calf.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear Mark.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh ... can&#8217;t be helped.&mdash;God, I did want
him to see the Walling! Won&#8217;t be any funeral.
Body goes straight to Sweden.... He&#8217;s left
Gurdy and Margot some money.... Awful
kindhearted.... Lot of old down and out actors&#8217;d
come here. Gave &#8217;em money. Awful kind
to me.... No reason.&#8221; His husky speech
made a chant for his old friend. Olive&#8217;s eyes
filled. He was childish in his woe, charming.
She wished that he&#8217;d weep so she could fondle the
red hair on her shoulder. This would hurt his
pleasure in the new theatre and the splendid play.
The butler came in after the heavy, descending
motion of men on the stairs was over and the
dull wheels had rolled off from the curb. He
brought a small, gold capped bottle and two
glasses on his tray.</p>

<p>&#8220;Doctor Lundquist said to bring this up, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>The champagne whispered delicately in the
glasses and washed down the muffling, dry taste<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
from Mark&#8217;s tongue. He smiled at Olive and
said, &#8220;Dunno what I&#8217;d have done without you
bein&#8217; here.&#8221; What a brave woman! Her
daughter had died swiftly of pneumonia before
Olive could reach her. Her son had been blown
to pieces.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad Gurdy didn&#8217;t get here,&#8221; she said,
&#8220;He&#8217;s seen quite enough of death and he was fond
of Mr. Carlson.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course. Fonder than Margot was. Bein&#8217;
a man, though, he never showed it so much.&#8221;</p>

<p>Olive hoped that Margot would never tell him
how she disliked the old man&#8217;s coarseness, his
manifold derisions. She said, &#8220;But go to bed,
Mark. You really should. These things strain
one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Awful. They packed me off to Aunt Edith&#8217;s
when mamma died. First time I ever saw any
one I liked.... Frohman was drowned.
Clyde Fitch died in France. Good night, Olive.&#8221;</p>

<p>He wished she would kiss him again and
watched her pass up to her rooms. Then he
went to bed, without thinking, and slept. He
slept soundly and woke slowly into warm, luxurious
sun that mottled the blue quilt. He said,
&#8220;Hello, brother,&#8221; to Gurdy who leaned on the
dresser between the windows, solemn and grieved
in a dark suit, his pale hair ruffled and gay with
light. Gurdy must be cheered up. &#8220;Well, you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
missed it. He didn&#8217;t have a pain. When did
you get here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A while ago. I&mdash;dad&#8217;s here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Eddie? Well, that&#8217;s good of him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bernamer came about the bed and dropped a
hand on Mark&#8217;s chest. He said nothing, but
grinned and sat down. His seemly clothes and
cropped head made him amazingly like Gurdy.
Mark beamed at both of them. &#8220;Had your
breakfast?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hell, yes,&#8221; said Bernamer, &#8220;Had two. Got
some coffee in Philadelphia and then Lady Ilden
made us eat somethin&#8217; when we got here.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mark swung out of bed and ordered Gurdy,
&#8220;Tell &#8217;em to bring me up some coffee in the
library, sonny. Oh, Margot ain&#8217;t got here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, she&#8217;s here,&#8221; said Gurdy and quickly left
the room.</p>

<p>The sun filled his showerbath. Mark cheered
further, babbled to his brother-in-law while he
shaved and wondered what Bernamer had talked
about to Olive at breakfast.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, we just talked,&#8221; said the farmer, curtly,
&#8220;Nice kind of woman.&#8221;</p>

<p>He leaned in the door of the bathroom and
rolled a cigarette in his big, shapely hands. Now
that he had five hired men his hands were softer
and not so thick. A fine, quiet man, full of sense.</p>

<p>&#8220;Awful good of you to come up, Eddie. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
ain&#8217;t makin&#8217; a fool of myself. The old man was
eighty. It&#8217;s a wonder he lasted as long.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Better get some coffee in you, bud. You look
run down.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Been workin&#8217; like a horse, Eddie.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mark knotted his tie, took Bernamer&#8217;s arm
and hugged it a little, walking into the library.
Olive dropped a newspaper and told him he
looked &#8220;gorgeous&#8221; in a weary voice, then poured
coffee into his cup on the low stand by a large
chair close to the fire. She was smoking. The
vapour didn&#8217;t hide yellowish hollows about her
eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I didn&#8217;t sleep well, old man. Rather
fagged.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We waked you up pretty early,&#8221; said Bernamer,
&#8220;Sit down, bud, and drink your coffee.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mark lounged in the deep chair. Bernamer
asked Olive if she had liked Washington but stood
patting Mark&#8217;s shoulder and rather troubled the
drinking of coffee. Gurdy came down the blue
rug with some mail.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look and see if there&#8217;s anything important,
sonny. Probably ain&#8217;t.... Hello, sister!&#8221;</p>

<p>Margot roamed down the library in a black
dress. But she paused yards from his stretched
hand and frowned incomprehensibly. Gurdy
turned at the desk with a letter against his grey<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
coat. Margot said, &#8220;I suppose Gurdy&#8217;s told
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gurdy thrust his jaw up toward the ceiling.
Olive rose with a flat, rasping &#8220;Margot&#8221; and
Bernamer hissed, his fingers tight on Mark&#8217;s
shoulder. Mark set down his coffee cup and
looked at them all.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no one&#8217;s said anything?&#8221; Margot put a
knee on a small chair and stroked the velvet back.
&#8220;Well, we&#8217;d better get it over. I was turned
out of the hotel in Philadelphia last&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shut up,&#8221; said Bernamer, &#8220;Shut your mouth!&#8221;</p>

<p>She went on, staring at Mark, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to
marry him as soon as he can get a divorce,
dad.... No use trying to lie about it. I belong
to Cosmo and&mdash;and that&#8217;s all.&#8221; She passed a
hand over her mouth. Then her bright slippers
twinkled as she walked out of the room. Mark
blinked after her. Something had happened.
He looked up at Bernamer whose face was rocky,
meaningless. Gurdy ran to Mark and spoke in
gasps, beating a fist on his hip.</p>

<p>&#8220;Russell called me at the farm about two&mdash;Dad
went down with me.&mdash;We talked to the manager&mdash;We
bribed him.&mdash;Russell gave the hotel
detective a check for a thousand dollars&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess they&#8217;ll keep their mouths shut,&#8221; said
Bernamer, &#8220;Told &#8217;em they&#8217;d each get another
check in six months if we didn&#8217;t hear nothin&#8217;.&mdash;Now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
it ain&#8217;t so bad, bud. Margot says this
feller can get a divorce from Cora Boyle&mdash;He was
gone and we didn&#8217;t see him. It might be worse.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Stop hittin&#8217; your leg, Gurd. You&#8217;ll hurt yourself,&#8221;
said Mark.</p>

<p>He rose and began to walk up and down the
tiles of the hearth. One of his hands patted the
front of his coat. His face was empty. He
seemed wonderfully thin. Olive watched him in
terror of a cry. Gurdy and his father drew off
against the shelves of still books. Bernamer commenced
rolling a cigarette. After a while Mark
said, &#8220;It&#8217;s the way I was brought up, Olive.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Mark, try to&mdash;to see her point of view.
She loved him. She sees something we don&#8217;t&mdash;It&#8217;s&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure. That&#8217;s so.&mdash;Oh, you&#8217;re right.&#8221;</p>

<p>He walked on, aware of them watching, helpless.
Things passed and turned in his head. He
was being silly, old-fashioned. Ought to collect
himself. Ought to do something for Gurdy who
wouldn&#8217;t have her, now. Get the boy something
to do. Get his mind off it. &#8220;Call the office,
sonny. Tell them to close &#8216;Todgers Intrudes.&#8217;
Give the company two weeks&#8217; pay. Have Hamlin
write checks&mdash;Didn&#8217;t try to thrash this Rand, did
you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We didn&#8217;t see him. He&#8217;d gone.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s good. Call the office.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>The boy went to the telephone, far off on its
desk and began to talk evenly. Mark stumbled
over to Bernamer and mumbled, &#8220;Keep him busy.
Awful jolt for him, Eddie. Takes it fine.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He ain&#8217;t in love with her, bud.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, he is.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Set down, bud. Better drink&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No.&mdash;Ain&#8217;t been any saint, myself. Girls are
different.&mdash;Maybe he&#8217;s a nice fellow.&mdash;Took it
nice about the play being closed.&mdash;I&#8217;m all right,
Olive. Sort of a shock.&#8221;</p>

<p>He walked on. Then he was too tired to walk
and Bernamer made him sit in the chair by the
hearth. He stared at the blue rug and it seemed
to clear his head. He became immobile, watching
a white thread. The world centred on this
wriggle of white on the blue down. He lapsed
into dullness, knowing that Gurdy stood close to
him. He should think of things to say, consolations.
The boy must be in tortures. He was
dull, empty.</p>

<p>Bernamer beckoned Olive. They went out of
the library and the farmer shut the door without
jarring the silver handle. Olive found herself
dizzy. She said, &#8220;You have something to&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s get downstairs where I can smoke.
You&#8217;re sick. This is as bad on you&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He helped her downstairs into the drawing
room and was gone, came back with water in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
which she tasted brandy. The big man lit his cigarette
and spoke in a drawl like Mark&#8217;s but heavier.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t understand this business. The little
fool says she&#8217;s been in love with this feller a long
time&mdash;a couple of years. He ain&#8217;t made love to
her &#8217;til last night. Well?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t understand it any more than do you.
I&#8217;m&mdash;horrified. I knew she admired his acting.
He&#8217;s handsome. Very handsome.&#8221;</p>

<p>The man nodded and his blue eyes were gentle
on her. He drawled, &#8220;Why the hell didn&#8217;t he
stay and face the music? The manager told him
to get out. Mr. Russell says he just packed up
and left.&mdash;I can&#8217;t make this out. Margot had
Mr. Russell waked up because she hadn&#8217;t any
money to come home with.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I must talk to her.... Why did we leave
her there?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You thought she&#8217;d got sense enough to know
better. It ain&#8217;t your fault. I got to go home
because I don&#8217;t want the family to know about this.
But there&#8217;s something damn funny in it.&mdash;Will
you please get it out of Mark&#8217;s head that Gurdy&#8217;s
in love with that girl? Make him feel better.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll do all I can.&#8221;</p>

<p>He said in scorn, &#8220;She ain&#8217;t worth fussin&#8217; with,&#8221;
and held the door open. Olive shivered, passing
the library where there was no sound. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
climbed to Margot&#8217;s room and found the girl sitting
on the edge of the sunny bed, still, smiling.</p>

<p>&#8220;You must be very tired, darling.&#8221;</p>

<p>The red lips a little parted. Margot said,
&#8220;Oh ... no,&#8221; in a soft whisper. The faint noise
died in the sun like the passage of a moth. Olive
stood fixed before the sleek tranquillity of the
black hair and the contented face. The restless
stirring was gone. She smiled in beautiful contentment.
The gold cord which was the girdle
of this velvet gown hung brilliant and rich about
the straight body. The sunny room made a shell
of colour for the figure. The hair had a dazzling
margin against the windows. She was untroubled,
happy.</p>

<p>Olive dragged at her own girdle, biting her lips.
She asked, &#8220;Where is Mr. Rand, dear?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He was coming to New York today,&#8221; Margot
said in the same voice. She lifted an end of the
trailing gold, then let it fall. She seemed asleep,
lost in a visible dream. But she roused and
spoke, &#8220;He&#8217;s loved me ever so long, Olive. I
didn&#8217;t know....&#8221; and was still again. Olive
choked before this happiness, turned and went
down the stairs. There was no use in artifice,
reasoning. Mark must accept what was done.
His good sense would come back, the shock would
ease into regret. His convention was outraged,
of course. It was dreadful to see him in pain.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
Olive thrust back her own pain, a vast and weary
disappointment. This wasn&#8217;t the man for the
girl. This was senseless. She entered the library
and Mark raised his face from the long stare at
the floor, dreading Margot.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; he said, &#8220;it ain&#8217;t your fault, Olive.
Don&#8217;t cry.&mdash;I&#8217;m bein&#8217; a fool.&#8221;</p>

<p>He rose and walked again, began a circular
tramp about the room. He passed through a
whispering tunnel, completely black. He was
marching in the dark and knew that Olive and
Gurdy watched him, that Bernamer came into the
room with his hat in a hand. Yet he walked in
blackness. He would go mad of this! She had
lied to him. She had thrown herself to a married
man. Well, girls did that. Things were changing.
People did queer things. He was jealous
for Gurdy, that was the trouble. He had wanted
her married to Gurdy. She had said such good
things of Gurdy.&mdash;All this time she&#8217;d been lying.
She was in love with this pink, married actor.&mdash;The
talk would roll among the restaurants, in
the offices. People would laugh. Awful names!
All the other noises would slacken and fail in this
whispering. They would sneer when the Walling
opened.&mdash;She couldn&#8217;t care anything for him or
she wouldn&#8217;t have lied. Gurdy didn&#8217;t lie. Mark
tore himself out of the black whispering and went
to take Gurdy&#8217;s sleeve.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you mind, sonny. She&mdash;she&#8217;d ought
to have told you she liked this&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Mark, I don&#8217;t care about her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right to say that&mdash;but don&#8217;t you mind.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bernamer came across the room and took Mark
in his arms. He said, &#8220;Now, bud, don&#8217;t upset
yourself. I got to go home. The fam&#8217;ly don&#8217;t
know nothin&#8217;. I shan&#8217;t say a word.&mdash;What you
do is this. Get hold of Cora Boyle and give her
money to let this feller divorce her, see? That&#8217;ll
save talk and trouble.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right, Eddie. Yes, good idea.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bernamer hugged him and left the room.
Mark&#8217;s head cleared. There was no black tunnel.
Eddie was right. He must make the best of this.
It could be hushed up. Women like Cora needed
money for clothes. He nodded to Gurdy, &#8220;You&#8217;ll
never be any smarter than your dad, son. Ain&#8217;t
he a nice fellow, Olive?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course, dear.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And I&#8217;m bein&#8217; a fool. I know it. Only
there&#8217;s lots of men that feel like I do about these
kind of things.&mdash;One o&#8217;clock.&mdash;You and Gurdy
have some lunch.&#8221;</p>

<p>Olive said, &#8220;Mark, would you like to talk to
her?&#8221;</p>

<p>He cried, &#8220;No!&mdash;I&mdash;might say something.
You folks go have lunch.&#8221; They went away and
at once he wanted them back, walked the floor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
with his hands clenched. He was afraid that
Margot might come in, now. He dreaded seeing
her. He wished her out of the house and away.
The wish bit him. He had been fooled. He had
to love her, help her. Couldn&#8217;t she go away?
To the farm, where no one knew and&mdash;But they
might find out. They would shrink from her as
bad. They weren&#8217;t knowing and tolerant like
Bernamer. He mustn&#8217;t stop loving her or let her
see that he was hurt. Nothing eased him. The
afternoon lagged along. Gurdy played the piano
downstairs. Gurdy and Olive drifted in, out,
consoling him. It was sunset. A van full of
boxes went slowly past the house and the shadows
on the pine were amethyst. Some friend of
Gurdy&#8217;s came calling in a yellow, low car that
turned ochre as the light failed. Its lamps made
ovals on the street as it drove away.&mdash;He mustn&#8217;t
let this sour the boy.&mdash;In the darker room the
whispering began again. It might be the blood
in his ears. Gurdy brought him up dinner and
white wine. Olive came afterwards and tried to
make him eat, lit all the soft lamps. He drank
some wine and smoked a cigarette.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gurdy takes it well, doesn&#8217;t he?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps he didn&#8217;t care as much as you think,
Mark.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mark laughed, &#8220;Awful cool outside. No, he&#8217;s
bein&#8217; brave to&mdash;cheer me up. And I feel better,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
honest.... My God, Olive, if that woman
wants to make a scandal!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t think of it, Mark.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was tired of thinking. He said, &#8220;I&#8217;ll try
not to,&#8221; and smiled at Gurdy coming in. But he
now thought of Cora Boyle.&mdash;Perhaps she liked
Rand, wouldn&#8217;t give him up. He examined the
rosy face, the trim grey suits. Yellow haired.
Perhaps these dark women liked yellow haired
men best. He was afraid of Cora. She
could lie to her friends and make things worse.
He stared at a lamp a long time and his mind
fell dull again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mark, it&#8217;s after ten. Go to bed,&#8221; said Olive,
&#8220;Please, old man.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You folks go.&mdash;Not sleepy.&#8221;</p>

<p>They left him. He was lonely. He sat by
the hearth and lit a cigarette. Above him there
was a slow noise of Gurdy strolling about, getting
undressed. The ripple of little sounds kept
Mark company, then deserted him. Mark shuddered
in the peace of the lit room. Something
worse would happen. What? He must save
Gurdy more pain. The boy was too young for
this. Mark&#8217;s throat ached suddenly and he
began to weep, spent in his chair. The lamps
of the room swelled like luminous pearls melting
and through the mist came Gurdy in white
pyjamas that flapped.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>&#8220;Oh, for God&#8217;s sake, Mark! Bed!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m scared,&#8221; said Mark, gulping, &#8220;Gurd, I&#8217;m
scared of Cora. Suppose she likes him? Suppose
she won&#8217;t let go of him? She&#8217;s bad tempered,
sonny. You don&#8217;t know her.&mdash;It&#8217;s the talk&mdash;the
talk. People ain&#8217;t as broad minded as you
and Olive think. The women, especially.&mdash;And
she&#8217;s a young girl.... It ain&#8217;t like she was one
of these women that&#8217;ve been divorced three or
four times.... If Cora makes a fuss&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Gurdy pulled him up out of the chair and gently
shook him. &#8220;You must come to bed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right.&mdash;Making a fool of myself....
Only, you&#8217;re in love with her. It&#8217;s hard on you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not in love with her, Mark!&#8221;</p>

<p>Mark thought this a splendid sort of lie but he
shivered. &#8220;Somethin&#8217; else might happen. I
feel.... Come and get me in bed, son.&#8221;</p>

<p>He became limply ashamed of himself. Gurdy
helped him to strip and he found the boy buttoning
his jacket for him as he sat on the edge
of his bed. He watched the long, wiry fingers
at work on the buttons and the holes of the blue
silk. The cold linen of the pillow caressed his
neck. He smiled, wanting Gurdy to stay there
until he fell asleep. The doorbell rang with a
steady and ripping insistence.</p>

<p>&#8220;Damn,&#8221; said Gurdy and went into the hall
where the cold air mounting from the opened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
door chilled his bare feet. The butler ascended
like a shadow on the white wainscot.</p>

<p>&#8220;A Mr. Fuller, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He can&#8217;t see Mr. Walling. He&#8217;s asleep.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He says he must see Mr. Walling, Mr.
Gurdy.&#8221; The butler held out his salver. Gurdy
read the card, Henry Fuller. Fuller and Marcovicz,
Attorneys at Law. Under the engraving
was pencilled, &#8220;For Miss Boyle.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gurdy walked down the stairs into the drawing
room. A burly man in a furred coat was standing
by the Siennese cabinet running a thumb over
the smooth panel of its little door. The light
made his grey hair glisten slickly. He turned a
broad, pleasing face on Gurdy and nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sorry to get &#8217;round here so late at night.
Pretty important I should see Mr. Walling
right away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s absolutely impossible. He&#8217;s ill and in
bed. I&#8217;m&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh ... you&#8217;re his nephew, ain&#8217;t you?
Mister&mdash;Bernamer?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>The man nodded and undid his coat. He wore
a dinner jacket with a fluted shirt. Gay stones
were blue in the soft pleats of the bosom. He
stated, &#8220;I&#8217;m from Miss Boyle&mdash;legal representative.
You tell Mr. Walling that Miss Boyle&#8217;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
willing to not bring an action against Miss Walling&mdash;Understand
what I mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>The lawyer continued his air of genial discretion,
getting a paper from some pocket. &#8220;Miss
Boyle&#8217;s willing to overlook this business in Philadelphia
and not sue her husban&#8217; or Miss Walling
provided that this play&#8217;s brought into New York
by New Year&#8217;s Day and Mr. Rand is featured&mdash;name
in electric lights and so on. Soon as the
play&#8217;s opened in New York she&#8217;ll live with her
husban&#8217; again. Condonation, see? And&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Blackmail,&#8221; said Gurdy.</p>

<p>The genial man went on, &#8220;I&#8217;ve got a memorandum,
here. All Mr. Walling&#8217;s got to do is sign
it. I&#8217;ll read it. N&#8217;York City, November eighteenth,
nineteen hundred nineteen. My dear
Miss Boyle, In pursuance of our agreement I
promise you that &#8216;Todgers Intrudes&#8217; will be
presented in New York City before January first,
nineteen twenty and that Mr. Rand will be featured
in the usual manner. Yours very truly.&mdash;All
he has to do is to put his name to that and
there you are.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gurdy hated this fellow. He rubbed a foot
on the carpet and sighed, then asked, &#8220;What&#8217;s the
good of this? It&#8217;s a bad play. It&#8217;ll fail. Why
does Miss Boyle want this?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>&#8220;Don&#8217;t ask me. Yes, I hear it&#8217;s a bum show.
I guess she wants her husban&#8217; featured. I don&#8217;t
know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If Mark&mdash;if Mr. Walling won&#8217;t sign this?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then Miss Boyle&#8217;ll bring her action in the
morning. There&#8217;s no defence, either, Mr. Bernamer.
Miss Boyle&#8217;s got a written statement
from Mr. Rand and testimony from his valet.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gurdy was sick, now. An unconquerable
tremor made the muscles of his back rigid. It
was a trap. Margot was caught in a trap. He
said, &#8220;Blackmail.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. Miss Boyle&#8217;s foregoin&#8217; a legal right to
bring her action. She ain&#8217;t askin&#8217; a cent of
money. There&#8217;s lots of ladies wouldn&#8217;t be so
easy to settle with. Better see what Mr. Walling
says, hadn&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>For a second Gurdy stood hopeless. Then he
said, &#8220;It&#8217;s a dirty trick,&#8221; and took the paper.
But he should keep cool. He smiled and inquired,
&#8220;You say you&#8217;ve got a written statement from
Mr. Rand&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Got a copy with me. Like to read it?&#8221;</p>

<p>Gurdy glanced at the transparent typed sheet.
He shook his head and walked up stairs. Mark
picked up the note as Gurdy dropped it on the
blue quilt, read it frowning. Then he flushed
and his mouth contracted hideously. He whispered,
&#8220;Old trick! Happens all the time. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
ought to have known what&#8217;d happen....
Gimme a pen, sonny.&#8221; He signed his full name,
Mark Henderson Walling. There couldn&#8217;t be
any more pain, after this. He shut his eyes and
fell through warm darkness. He could not sleep
but he must rest. He slept.</p>

<p>When Gurdy came back into the bedroom,
Mark was slowly breathing, sound asleep. The
boy made the place dark and went up to his own
room. In the upper black of the hall some one
caught his arm. Olive followed him and shut the
door. She had cast a black fur cloak over her
night dress and her grey hair was loose. She
looked at the boy without a word, leaning on the
door.</p>

<p>&#8220;Blackmail. She sent her lawyer. She&#8217;s got
a confession from Rand. Mark&#8217;s signed an
agreement. He&#8217;ll bring that play into New York
and she&#8217;ll live with Rand as soon as it opens.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah!... Oh, the cad!... Oh, Gurdy,
take care of Mark!&#8221;</p>

<p>She walked down the hall. Gurdy followed
her and heard her pity crash into miserable sobs
behind her door. He stood listening for a while
then raised his arm and pressed it against his
mouth.</p>

The Walling</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">ON Saturday afternoon, Olive and Margot
started for Seattle. Gurdy drove with
them to the station and Margot spoke
to him for the first time since the journey from
Philadelphia. She said, &#8220;What theatre will dad
bring &#8216;Todgers&#8217; into?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know. It&#8217;ll be hard to find one.&#8221;</p>

<p>She murmured, &#8220;It ought to be a great success,&#8221;
and Gurdy admired her stubborn air. She sat
stiffly in a suit of yellow cloth and walked stiffly
down the great stairs of the station, gathering
eyes, moved ahead of Olive and himself to the
coach and stood in the vestibule, motionless,
uninterested when Olive drew Gurdy away to the
edge of the concrete and raised her veil.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mark need never see the child again unless&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, he&#8217;ll be all right,&#8221; Gurdy decided, &#8220;but
it&#8217;s been an awful jolt.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Englishwoman put a hand to her mouth
which shivered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Awful.... Oh, I don&#8217;t know, Gurdy!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t know what, Lady Ilden?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know that he&#8217;s right in sacrificing himself....
I don&#8217;t know that he&#8217;s wrong. Chivalry....
I can&#8217;t understand how two people
can be such beasts as this woman and her
husband.... Deliberate torture.... Isn&#8217;t it
revenge?&#8221;</p>

<p>Gurdy didn&#8217;t answer but asked, &#8220;You&#8217;ll go on
from Japan to&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;South Africa. I&#8217;ve some friends at Capetown....
She&#8217;s that brutal age, when it doesn&#8217;t
matter if we get what we want.... Oh, my dear
boy, this is hideous! It&#8217;s revenge!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think so,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I saw Russell at
the office this morning. &#8216;Todgers&#8217; doesn&#8217;t open
in Baltimore until Monday. He says that Rand
talked to him in Philadelphia before this happened
and wanted Russell to persuade Mark to risk
bringing the play to New York and that was after
Mark had told him he wouldn&#8217;t bring it in.
Russell thinks she&mdash;Cora Boyle&mdash;is simply crazy
over Rand. Russell&#8217;s seen a good deal of them.
He says Rand talked to her by &#8217;phone from
Philadelphia on Tuesday. She may have put
him up to this. I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s revenge. She&#8217;s
got nothing to revenge. Mark&#8217;s always been
decent to her.&#8221;</p>

<p>Olive smiled and then whispered, &#8220;Do take care
of Mark.&#8221; A porter came bawling, &#8220;All
aboard,&#8221; and groups broke up along the train.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
Margot swung and vanished into the coach.
Olive said, &#8220;She&#8217;s stunned. She won&#8217;t realize
she&#8217;s been a beast to Mark for a while.&#8221; Gurdy
mumbled something about points of view. The
tired woman cut him short with, &#8220;Rot, old man!
She didn&#8217;t play fair. She lied. Do take care of
Mark. Good-bye.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gurdy walked away and a clerk from Mark&#8217;s
office brushed by him with a papered load of
yellow roses. The boy turned and saw Olive
take these against her black furs. She stood
graciously thanking the clerk for a moment, smiling.
Then she stepped into the vestibule and the
train stirred. Gurdy walked on. The colossal
motion of the crowd in the brilliant station was a
relief and a band hammered out some military
march by a Red Cross booth. His spirit lifted;
the strained waiting of three days was done; Margot
was gone; Gurdy wouldn&#8217;t have to watch
Mark&#8217;s piteous effort at normality. He found
his uncle alone in the office at the 45th Street
Theatre, studying a model for a scene and swiftly
Mark asked, &#8220;I sent Jim with some&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He got there.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mark sighed and rubbed his hair. Everything
confused him. He hoped Olive would forgive
him for not coming to the station. That had
been cowardly. He said, &#8220;Ought to have gone
along, son.... Afraid I&#8217;d say something I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
shouldn&#8217;t. I shouldn&#8217;t have let you do it alone.
This is worse on you than it is on me. I&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mark, on my honour, I&#8217;m not in love with
Margot!&#8221;</p>

<p>He lied so nobly that Mark wondered at him
and brought out a thin chuckle. &#8220;You&#8217;re a card,
son!... If I didn&#8217;t know better I&#8217;d almost believe
you.... Well, take a look at this set.
That left wall looks kind of dark to me. It&#8217;s ox
blood and it might light up with spots on it.
What d&#8217;you think?&#8221;</p>

<p>Callers interfered. Gurdy went down the
stairs into the lobby packed with women who came
out from the matinée. All these decorated bodies
flowed left and right about a dull blue placard
announcing, &#8220;Early in December The Walling
Theatre will open with &#8216;Captain Salvador&#8217; by
Stephen O&#8217;Mara,&#8221; and some women paused, drawing
on gloves, fussing with veils. A slim and
black haired girl stared boldly at Gurdy, passing
him. She wasn&#8217;t like Margot but he hated her
for an instant and then stalked up Sixth Avenue
where the lights of restaurants roused in the dusk
and the crowd of Saturday evening brayed. In
ten cool blocks Gurdy captured his philosophy,
held it firmly; Mark was unreasonably hurt&mdash;in
fact, Mark was an old-fashioned, unphilosophic
fellow who hadn&#8217;t progressed, was still a country
boy in essence, hadn&#8217;t even gained the inferior<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
cynicism of his trade and friends. He was letting
himself be bullied by Cora Boyle on an antique
concept. Why should he let himself be laughed
at and lose money for this immaterial thing?
Gurdy succeeded in getting angry at Mark and
tramped about the blue library preparing a lecture,
saw a glove of Margot&#8217;s on a table and
tossed it into a waste basket. He could imagine
Mark shedding tears over that empty glove and
its presence in the copper basket fretted Gurdy.
He plucked it forth and flung it into the fire of
cedar logs where it made a satisfactory hiss,
blackening. It must have been perfumed. A
scent floated out of the fire. Gurdy grinned over
the symbol and poked the remnant which crumbled
and was nothing. He stood reducing Margot&#8217;s
importance to logical ash and so intently that he
jumped when the butler told him that Russell was
downstairs. The director strolled in and looked
about the room before speaking.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nice walls,&#8221; he said, &#8220;Well, Gurdy, I&#8217;ve just
seen Miss Boyle.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;At her hotel.&mdash;I&#8217;m mixed up in this and I
thought I might help Mr. Walling out. So I
went to see her and had a talk. It didn&#8217;t come
to anything.&#8221; He sat down in Mark&#8217;s fireside
chair, stooped his head and brooded, &#8220;I&#8217;d a sneaking
idea that this game was a sort of revenge.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
Walling&#8217;s been good to her&mdash;done things for her.
That might rankle. Well, I pointed out that
&#8216;Todgers&#8217; is a waste of time. I did my best to
make her see that. It was funny.... She sat
on a lounge and rocked a cushion as if it were a
baby&mdash;in her arms&mdash;Has she ever had a child?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think not.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And she&#8217;s ten or eleven years older than
Rand.... It&#8217;s no good. She thinks he&#8217;s great
in this play and she thinks it&#8217;ll run all winter in
New York. And there we are, Bernamer. She&#8217;s
set on the thing. Mr. Walling had better get it
over as soon as he can. If he doesn&#8217;t, she&#8217;ll be
ugly. I&#8217;m mighty sorry.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gurdy blazed up in a mixture of wrath and impatience,
&#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s all such damned rot! Mark&#8217;s
one of the best producers in the country and he
shouldn&#8217;t do this!... He should tell her to go
to hell. It&#8217;s blackmail! I&#8217;m going to tell
him&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>After a moment Russell asked, &#8220;What?&#8221; and
laughed kindly. Gurdy shrugged and flinched
before the laughter. The man was right. Mark
would go through with the beastly deal, wouldn&#8217;t
consider risking Margot&#8217;s name. There was no
use in argument. He snapped, &#8220;Chivalry!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you wouldn&#8217;t do it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Gurdy, &#8220;No! It&#8217;s too thick. It
is ironical. And he can&#8217;t tell any one. Everyone&#8217;ll<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
think he thinks this is a good play&mdash;worth
doing. The critics&#8217;ll jump all over him.
They&#8217;ll&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The other proposition being that Miss Walling
will lose her reputation? She&#8217;s a young girl
and not very clever or very sophisticated, to judge
by her talk. She&#8217;s read the smart novels, of
course. Quotes them a good deal.... You say
you wouldn&#8217;t do this for her? The world being
as it is? Tell it to the fish, Bernamer!&#8221; Gurdy
felt weak before the cool, genial voice. Russell
lit a pipe and went on, &#8220;I feel the way you do.
Only the world&#8217;s full of shorn lambs and the
wind&#8217;s damned cold.... Can you come to a
show tonight?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Lord, no,&#8221; said Gurdy, &#8220;I&#8217;ve got to stay with
Mark. He&#8217;s got to have some one with him.
Needs taking care of&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Russell said, &#8220;To be sure,&#8221; with another laugh
and went away. He sent Gurdy the notices from
the Baltimore papers after &#8220;Todgers Intrudes&#8221;
began its week there and with them a note:
&#8220;Miss Boyle came down for the opening. She
is still sure this is a great play. Maternal feeling.
Rand seems nervous and loses his lines a good
deal. He is probably ashamed of himself. His
English accent peels off now and then and he talks
flat Middle West American,&#8221; but the same mail
brought a letter from Olive Ilden, written at Denver,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
and this maddened Gurdy, as last proof of
Margot&#8217;s inconsequence.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear Gurdy, The reaction has started. She
is now certain that Rand planned the whole filthy
trick. She is so angry that there is nothing left
unsaid. He is a cheap bounder and a slacker etc.
An actor can not be anything else, she says.
Everything is Mark&#8217;s fault or mine for leaving
her alone in Philadelphia. Do try to pity her a
little, old man. She has made a fearful fool of
herself and knows it. The whole thing is still
horrible to me. I wish Mark had more humour
or more cold blood. Anything to help him
through. I keep trying to remember a quotation
from Webster I threw at his head once. &#8216;These
be the fair rewards of those that love.&#8217; It may
be from Shakespeare. Did you try to argue him
out of making the production in New York?
That would be your logical attitude. But do take
care of him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gurdy tore the note up and went to pull on his
riding clothes. The frost had melted. Mark
wanted a ride in the warm park. The boy
thought proudly that Mark hadn&#8217;t complained.
He seemed quietly busy, arranging advertisements
for &#8220;Captain Salvador&#8221; which toured New
England after its week of Boston. Rumours of
a triumph crept ahead of the play. Its success,
its investiture of light and colour would soothe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
Mark while he still needed soothing. Gurdy
rattled downstairs and Mark laughed at him,
&#8220;You look mighty well in ridin&#8217; things, son!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So do you,&#8221; said Gurdy, in all honesty, and
watched Mark beam, settling his boots, the fit of
his black coat. They rode into the empty Park.
Mark talked about horses and then about Gurdy&#8217;s
brothers. One of them wanted to be a soldier.</p>

<p>&#8220;You did that with your scar and all,&#8221; Mark
said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Funny how easy a kid gets an ambition. Only
thirteen. He&#8217;ll get over it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What did you want to be when you were thirteen,
sonny?&#8221;</p>

<p>Gurdy strove to remember. He had probably
wanted to be a theatrical manager. He said,
&#8220;I wanted to be a barber when I was nine or ten,
I remember that. And then I wanted to be an
aviator&mdash;and now I want to write plays....&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hurry and write me a good one, brother.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Mark was silent. They cantered along
in the creamy sunlight. A great lady of artistic
tastes reducing her weight bowed jerkily to Mark
from her burdened gelding and called, &#8220;Can you
bring Miss Walling to luncheon Sunday?&#8221;
Gurdy saw Mark&#8217;s mouth twist. It needed courage
to call so easily back, &#8220;She&#8217;s gone to Japan.&#8221;
But a hundred yards afterward Mark reined in
and stared at the sun, his face tormented.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>&#8220;Sonny, I may have to open the Walling with
&#8216;Todgers Intrudes&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fact. I can&#8217;t take a chance with Cora gettin&#8217;
nasty. I can&#8217;t risk it. And I can&#8217;t get a house
for love or money. I tried to buy the show out of
the Princess last night. There ain&#8217;t a house empty....
I may have to use the Walling&mdash;open it
with this&mdash;this&mdash;&#8221; He slashed his crop though
the air, was ashamed of himself and sat chewing
a lip. Gurdy could keep his emotions so well
covered just as he now hid and nobly lied about
his heartbreak over Margot. Mark&#8217;s sense of
hurt swelled and broke out, &#8220;Oh, women are hell!
If they want a thing they&#8217;ll do anything to get it!
They&mdash;they scare me, Gurd! When they want
a thing!... And look how she treated you!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Mark, honestly, I wasn&#8217;t in love with
her!&#8221;</p>

<p>Mark knew better but Gurdy&#8217;s brave mendacity
cheered him. He grinned and rode on. He
must think of ways to make Gurdy forget the girl.
When they reached the house he telephoned the
gayest folk he could find and summoned them to a
luncheon. He worked in a fever, keeping Gurdy
busy with new plays, ritual lunches at the Algonquin
and motor trips to country inns where they
hadn&#8217;t been with Margot who somehow wavered
in Mark&#8217;s mind. He began to lose an immediate,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
answering picture of her. It was hard to recall
her phrases of later time. Things she had said
and poses of her childhood rose more clearly.
She merged in his perplexed hunt for a theatre.
When he found, on the first of December, that
he couldn&#8217;t rent or beg a playhouse for &#8220;Todgers
Intrudes&#8221; he hated Margot for an hour and
tramped his library in a sweat of loathing. He
must defame the Walling with this nonsense, finish
his bargain by dishonouring himself and his
dream, for the Walling was not altogether real.
He roamed the shell where workmen were covering
the naked chairs with dull blue, in a haze.
The smell of banana oil and turpentine made him
dizzy. The silver and black boxes seemed vaporous
like the mist of the ceiling when the lamps
were tried on its surface. He had moments of
sheer glory through which came burning the
thought of Cora Boyle and Margot, in this queer
alliance. His offices were transferred to broad
rooms by the white landing of the wide stairs in
the Walling. There was an alcove for Gurdy&#8217;s
desk and here Mark told him suddenly, &#8220;Goin&#8217;
to bring &#8216;Todgers&#8217; in here next week, son.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gurdy paled, leaned on the new desk and flexed
his hands on his fair head. He said, &#8220;Oh, no!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Got to, son. I&#8217;ve tried all I know.&#8221;</p>

<p>The boy babbled, &#8220;Don&#8217;t do it!... Oh,
damn it! You&#8217;ve been working for this place for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
years and&mdash;It&#8217;s not worth it! Look here, let me
go talk to this damned woman!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. I&#8217;ve got some pride left, son. You
shan&#8217;t go near her. You go down to the farm
and stay with the folks.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gurdy wanted nothing more. All the pressmen
and underlings were puzzled by Mark&#8217;s maintenance
of the English comedy on the road. It
was not making money. The theatrical weeklies
had warned New York how bad was &#8220;Todgers
Intrudes.&#8221; Gurdy drove his motor down to
Fayettesville on Saturday, had a fit of shame and
hurried back on Sunday. On the face of the
Walling the dead electric bulbs told the news,
&#8220;Mark Walling Presents Todgers Intrudes With
Cosmo Rand&#8221; and Mark&#8217;s treasurer came out of
the white doors to expostulate.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t get this. Your uncle&#8217;s playin&#8217; for a
dead loss, Mr. Bernamer. It&#8217;s no damn good.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is he?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Went up to New Haven yesterday. &#8216;Captain
Salvador&#8217; played there last night. Say,
what&#8217;s the idea? This &#8216;Todgers&#8217; ain&#8217;t done a
thing but eat up money. Every one knows it&#8217;s a
frost!&#8221; The man worried openly.</p>

<p>There could be no explanation, Gurdy saw.
The critics would jeer. Mark&#8217;s friends would
chaff him. The boy patted his wheel and asked,
&#8220;What night does it open?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>&#8220;Wednesday, like &#8216;Captain Salvador&#8217; was to.
Honest, Mr. Bernamer, this is hell!&#8221;</p>

<p>Gurdy drove off to a restaurant for dinner and
here a critic stopped him on the sill to ask
whether Mark had gone &#8220;quite, quite mad?&#8221;
Monday was barren anguish, watching Mark&#8217;s
face. &#8220;Captain Salvador&#8221; would play in Hartford
and Providence all week. On Tuesday
there was a rehearsal of &#8220;Todgers Intrudes&#8221; and
Gurdy found a black motor initialed C. B. when
he came to the Walling. Workmen were polishing
the brass of the outer doors and the programs
for tomorrow night were ready. Everything
was ready for the sick farce. On Wednesday
morning Mark ate breakfast with heroic grins
and talked of playing golf in the afternoon.
But he hadn&#8217;t slept well. His eyes were flecked
with red. Bone showed under his cheeks. His
black had an air of candid mourning.</p>

<p>&#8220;The best joke&#8217;d be if the damned thing made
a hit,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think that would be a little too ironical,&#8221;
Gurdy snapped.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is what you&#8217;d call ironical, ain&#8217;t it?
Well, I&#8217;m going down to the office for a minute.
Don&#8217;t come. Send for the horses and we&#8217;ll go
riding about eleven.&#8221;</p>

<p>He walked to the Walling, was halted a dozen
times and found the antechamber full of people.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
Some had appointments. He sat talking for an
hour and then started downstairs. But he saw
Cosmo Rand on the white floor of the vestibule,
slim in a grey furred coat, reading a newspaper.
The blue walls of the stair seemed to press Mark&#8217;s
head. He turned back into the office and sent
for his house manager. When the man came
Mark said, &#8220;I&#8217;m not going to be here tonight,
Billy. Tell anybody that asks I&#8217;m sick as a dog
and couldn&#8217;t come.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right. Say, sir, would you mind telling
me just why&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Mark beamed across the desk and lied, &#8220;Why,
this fellow Dufford that wrote this is a friend of
mine and he&#8217;s poor as a churchmouse. I thought
I&#8217;d take a chance.&#8221;</p>

<p>The manager shuffled and blurted, &#8220;It&#8217;s a damn
poor chance.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mighty poor, Billy. Well, the show business
is a gamble, anyhow.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rand was gone from the vestibule. Mark
walked seething over Broadway and into Sixth
Avenue. He must think of something to do, tonight.
He couldn&#8217;t sit at home. The flags on
the Hippodrome wagged to him. He went there
and bought two seats. The tickets stayed unmentioned
in his pocket all the deadly afternoon.
At six he said shyly to Gurdy, &#8220;Think you want
to see this tonight, son?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>&#8220;Might as well, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>The &#8220;sir&#8221; pleased Mark. It rang respectfully.
He stammered, &#8220;I got a couple of seats for the
show at the Hippodrome and&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s good,&#8221; Gurdy said, &#8220;We needn&#8217;t dress,
then.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Mark sat haunted in the vast theatre,
watching the stage. He had deserted his own,
run from disaster. The Walling revenged itself.
He saw the misty ceiling wane as lights lowered
and the remote rims of silver mirrors fade in the
corners of the gallery. The glow from the stage
would show the massed shoulders of women in
the black boxes. Cora Boyle would be sitting
in the righthand box. She might wear a yellow
gown. He would risk seeing that to be mixed
in his dream. It was the best theatre of the city,
of the world. He blinked at the monstrous
evolutions of this chorus, peered at Gurdy and
saw the boy sit moodily, knee over knee, listless
from grieving, his arms locked. The time ticked
on Mark&#8217;s wrist&mdash;The critics would be filing into
the white vestibule where men must admire the
dull blue panels of clear enamel, the simple,
grooved ceiling and the hidden lamps. The
yellow smoke room would be full. He wanted
to be there in the face of derision. A dry aching
shook Mark. It was like the past time when
Gurdy first went to school or when Margot had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
gone to England; the Walling was his child.
He had desired it beyond any woman. He
adored it out of his wretchedness. He pressed
his shoulder against Gurdy for the sake of
warmth and Gurdy grinned loyally at him. There
was no one so kind as Gurdy who began to tell
silly tales when they came home and sat on
Mark&#8217;s bed smoking cigarettes. In the morning
the boy brought up the papers and said gruffly,
&#8220;Not as bad as I thought&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, get out! I bet they&#8217;re fierce,&#8221; Mark
laughed, &#8220;Read me some.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gurdy dropped the damp sheets on the quilt,
glared at them and dashed his hand against the
foot of the bed. He cried, &#8220;I don&#8217;t give a
d-damn what they say about the play! They&#8217;ve
no right to talk about you like that!&#8221;</p>

<p>Immense warmth flooded Mark. He sat up
and said, &#8220;Sure they have. For all they know I
thought this thing was fine.... God bless you,
son!&#8221; He wanted to do something for Gurdy
directly. &#8220;Say, for heaven&#8217;s sake, brother, those
clothes are too thin for winter. We&#8217;ll run down
and order you some. And let&#8217;s go down to the
farm. I ain&#8217;t seen dad and your mother in a
dog&#8217;s age.&mdash;And hell, this ain&#8217;t so bad, Gurdy.
The thing&#8217;ll dry up and blow away. We&#8217;ll bring
&#8216;Captain Salvador&#8217; in. I&#8217;ve had worse luck on a
rabbit hunt.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>But at Fayettesville where his father asked
why Margot hadn&#8217;t come to say good-bye, Mark
was still plagued by visionary glimpses of the
Walling, half-filled by yawning folk, the black
boxes empty. The flat country was deep in moist
snow. Snow had to be considered. Audiences
laughed nowadays at the best paper flakes. He
talked to Gurdy about it on Saturday morning.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pale blue canvas with the whitest light you
can get jammed on it. That might work.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mark, if you couldn&#8217;t have scenery for a play
would you&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Mark scoffed, &#8220;What&#8217;s a play without scenery?&mdash;Hey,
look at the red car.... No, it&#8217;s a motor-bike.&#8221;</p>

<p>A lad on a red motorcycle whipped in a bright
streak up the lane and through a snow ball battle
of Gurdy&#8217;s brothers. He had a telegram for
Mark from the house manager of the Walling:
&#8220;No sale for next week. Miss Boyle requests
play be withdrawn. Instruct.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Got her bellyfull,&#8221; Mark said and scribbled
a return message ordering &#8220;Todgers Intrudes&#8221;
withdrawn then another to the manager of
&#8220;Captain Salvador&#8221; in Providence. He told
Gurdy, &#8220;Now, she can&#8217;t say a thing. Well, let&#8217;s
get back to town, son. We&#8217;ll have a lot to do,
bringing &#8216;Salvador&#8217; in next Wednesday.&#8221;</p>

<p>His motor carried them swiftly up New Jersey.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
Gurdy lounged and chattered beside Mark who
couldn&#8217;t feel triumphant though he tried. The
drive had been made so often with Margot and
now he saw the child in all clarity, her bright
pumps and the silver buckles she so liked stretched
on the warmer close to his feet. Her older
beauty flickered and faded like some intervening
mist. Pain stabbed and jarred him. The snow
of the upland gave out. Rain began. When
they reached Broadway its lights were violet and
wistful in the swirl above umbrellas.</p>

<p>&#8220;God, what an ugly town,&#8221; said Gurdy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ain&#8217;t it? Don&#8217;t know what people that like
something pretty&#8217;d do if it weren&#8217;t for the shows&mdash;and
the damned movies.&#8221;</p>

<p>They dined in a restaurant and another manager
chaffed Mark about &#8220;Todgers Intrudes&#8221;
leaning drunk on the table.</p>

<p>&#8220;And I hear it goes to the storehouse?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes ... but the show business is a gamble,
Bill.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ain&#8217;t it? Say, have you seen this hunk of
nothin&#8217; I&#8217;ve got up to my place? Have you seen
it? God, go up and take a look at it! I get a
bellyache every time I go near it. Turnin&#8217; them
away, though. Well, here today and hell tomorrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>His treasurer came to meet Mark in the glittering
vestibule where a few men smoked forlornly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
against the blue panels. Mark glanced at the
slip showing the receipts and laughed, commenced
talking of &#8220;Captain Salvador.&#8221; His force gathered
about him. Gurdy strolled away. A petty
laughter rattled out of the doors and Gurdy
passed in. The lit stage showed him a sprinkle
of heads on the sweep of the seats. There was no
one in the boxes. Two ushers were rolling dice
by the white arch of the smokeroom. A couple
of women left the poor audience and hurried by
the boy dejectedly. He walked out through the
vestibule where more men were collecting around
Mark&#8217;s height and the swift happiness of his face
as he talked of next week. Gurdy marched
along the proud front of the theatre and turned
into the alley that led from street to street. One
bulb shone above the stage door and sent down
a glistening coat for the large black motor standing
there. Gurdy kept close to the other wall.
There was a woman smoking in the limousine.
The spark made a heart inside the shadow.
Gurdy stared and was eaten by rage against her.
He stood staring.</p>

<p>The stage door opened. The few performers
began to leave. They moved up or down the
alley to join the bright motion of the glowing
streets outside. Their feet stirred the pools of
rain on the pavement. Their voices ebbed and
tinkled in the lofty alley. At last a slim man in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
a grey coat ran from the door and jumped into the
black motor which moved, now, and slid away,
jolted into the southward street. Gurdy was
moving, too, when other lights woke high on the
brick wall. An iron shutter grated, opening, and
men appeared in the fissure. They bellowed
down to the old doorkeeper, &#8220;Ain&#8217;t them guys
from Cain&#8217;s got here, yet?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They ain&#8217;t to come &#8217;til eleven fifteen.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hell, it&#8217;s after!&#8221;</p>

<p>The stage hands cursed merrily. One of them
mimicked Rand&#8217;s English accent to much
applause. Then the great drays from the storehouse
came grinding along the alley in a steam
as the horses snorted. The stage hands and
carters swore at each other. The vast screens
were slung and handed down. The fleet quality
of this failure bit Gurdy. He leaned dreary on
the wall and saw Mark standing close to him,
face raised to the lights, an odd small grin twisting
his mouth. Mark did not move or speak.</p>

<p>He was thinking confusedly of many things.
It was hard to think at all. One of the stage
hands whistled a waltz that people liked. The
melody caught at Mark&#8217;s mind and drew it away
from the moment, forward and back. He
hunted justice. Things went wrong. People
weren&#8217;t kind. Next week the new play would
glitter and people would applaud. Gurdy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
might come to write plays, the best possible plays.
He watched the wreck melt. People would forget
this. It would sink into shadow. No one
would understand but they would forget. It was
trivial in his long success. It horribly hurt him.
He had been fooled in love. It was laughable.
Things happened so. One must go on and forget
about them. One of the horses neighed and
stamped. A blue spark jetted up from the pavement,
above a pool.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here goes nothin&#8217;,&#8221; a stage hand yelled, letting
down the last screen. The iron shutter closed
over the laughter. The carters whined and the
drays were backed down the alley. The rain fell
silently between Mark the red of the wall making
it purple&mdash;a wonderful colour. The guiding
lights went out. Mark sighed and took Gurdy&#8217;s
arm. They walked together toward the gleaming
crowd of the street. Yet feeling this warmth
beside him Mark walked without much pain.</p>
